  "\n\n"
  "This class was introduced to simplify operations on polygon sets like boolean or sizing operations. "
  "Regions consist of many polygons and thus are a generalization of single polygons which describes "
  "a single coherence set of points. Regions support a variety of operations and have several states. "
  "\n\n"
  "The region's state can be empty (does not contain anything) or box-like, i.e. the region consists "
  "of a single box. In that case, some operations can be simplified. Regions can have merged state. In merged "
  "state, regions consist of merged (non-touching, non-self overlapping) polygons. Each polygon describes "
  "one coherent area in merged state."
  "\n\n"
  "The preferred representation of polygons inside the region are polygons with holes."
  "\n\n"
  "Regions are always expressed in database units. If you want to use regions from different database unit "
  "domains, scale the regions accordingly, i.e. by using the \\transformed method.\n"
  "\n\n"
  "Regions provide convenient operators for the boolean operations. Hence it is often no longer required "
  "to work with the \\EdgeProcessor class. For example:\n"
  "\n"
  "@code\n"
  "r1 = RBA::Region::new(RBA::Box::new(0, 0, 100, 100))\n"
  "r2 = RBA::Region::new(RBA::Box::new(20, 20, 80, 80))\n"
  "# compute the XOR:\n"
  "r1_xor_r2 = r1 ^ r2\n"
  "@/code\n"
  "\n"
  "Regions can be used in two different flavors: in raw mode or merged semantics. With merged semantics (the "
  "default), connected polygons are considered to belong together and are effectively merged.\n"
  "Overlapping areas are counted once in that mode. Internal edges (i.e. arising from cut lines) are not considered.\n"
  "In raw mode (without merged semantics), each polygon is considered as it is. Overlaps between polygons\n"
  "may exists and merging has to be done explicitly using the \\merge method. The semantics can be\n"
  "selected using \\merged_semantics=.\n"
  "\n\n"
  "This class has been introduced in version 0.23.\n"
