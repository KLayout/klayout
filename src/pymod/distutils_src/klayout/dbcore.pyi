    @brief A box class with integer coordinates

    This object represents a box (a rectangular shape).

    The definition of the attributes is: p1 is the lower left point, p2 the 
    upper right one. If a box is constructed from two points (or four coordinates), the 
    coordinates are sorted accordingly.

    A box can be empty. An empty box represents no area
    (not even a point). Empty boxes behave neutral with respect to most operations. 
    Empty boxes return true on \empty?.

    A box can be a point or a single
    line. In this case, the area is zero but the box still
    can overlap other boxes for example and it is not empty. 

    See @<a href="/programming/database_api.xml">The Database API@</a> for more details about the database objects.

    @brief A cell

    A cell object consists of a set of shape containers (called layers),
    a set of child cell instances and auxiliary information such as
    the parent instance list.
    A cell is identified through an index given to the cell upon instantiation.
    Cell instances refer to single instances or array instances. Both are encapsulated in the
    same object, the \CellInstArray object. In the simple case, this object refers to a single instance.
    In the general case, this object may refer to a regular array of cell instances as well.

    Starting from version 0.16, the child_inst and erase_inst methods are no longer available since
    they were using index addressing which is no longer supported. Instead, instances are now addressed
    with the \Instance reference objects.

    See @<a href="/programming/database_api.xml">The Database API@</a> for more details about the database objects like the Cell class.

        All shapes are copied from the source cell to this cell. Instances are not copied.

        The source cell can reside in a different layout. In this case, the shapes are copied over from the other layout into this layout. Database unit conversion is done automatically if the database units differ between the layouts. Note that this may lead to grid snapping effects if the database unit of the target layout is not an integer fraction of the source layout.

        If source and target layout are different, the layers of the source and target layout are identified by their layer/datatype number or name (if no layer/datatype is present).
        The shapes will be added to any shapes already in the cell.

        This method creates a regular pattern of fill cells to cover the interior of the given region as far as possible. This process is also known as tiling. This implementation supports rectangular (not necessarily square) tile cells. The tile cell's footprint is given by the fc_box parameter and the cells will be arranged with their footprints forming a seamless array.

        The algorithm supports a global fill raster as well as local (per-polygon) origin optimization. In the latter case the origin of the regular raster is optimized per individual polygon of the fill region. To enable optimization, pass 'nil' to the 'origin' argument.

        The implementation will basically try to find a repetition pattern of the tile cell's footprint and produce instances which fit entirely into the fill region.

        There is also a version available which offers skew step vectors as a generalization of the orthogonal ones.

        If the 'remaining_parts' argument is non-nil, the corresponding region will receive the parts of the polygons which are not covered by tiles. Basically the tiles are subtracted from the original polygons. A margin can be specified which is applied separately in x and y direction before the subtraction is done ('fill_margin' parameter).

        If the 'remaining_polygons' argument is non-nil, the corresponding region will receive all polygons from the input region which could not be filled and where there is no chance of filling because not a single tile will fit into them.

        'remaining_parts' and 'remaining_polygons' can be identical with the input. In that case the input will be overwritten with the respective output. Otherwise, the respective polygons are added to these regions.

        This allows setting up a more elaborate fill scheme using multiple iterations and local origin-optimization ('origin' is nil):

        @code
        r = ...        # region to fill
        c = ...        # cell in which to produce the fill cells
        fc_index = ... # fill cell index
        fc_box = ...   # fill cell footprint

        fill_margin = RBA::Point::new(0, 0)   # x/y distance between tile cells with different origin

        # Iteration: fill a region and fill the remaining parts as long as there is anything left.
        # Polygons not worth being considered further are dropped (last argument is nil).
        while !r.is_empty?
          c.fill_region(r, fc_index, fc_box, nil, r, fill_margin, nil)
        end
        @/code

        The glue box parameter supports fill cell array compatibility with neighboring regions. This is specifically useful when putting the fill_cell method into a tiling processor. Fill cell array compatibility means that the fill cell array continues over tile boundaries. This is easy with an origin: you can chose the origin identically over all tiles which is sufficient to guarantee fill cell array compatibility across the tiles. However there is no freedom of choice of the origin then and fill cell placement may not be optimal. To enable the origin for the tile boundary only, a glue box can given. The origin will then be used only when the polygons to fill not entirely inside and not at the border of the glue box. Hence, while a certain degree of freedom is present for the placement of fill cells inside the glue box, the fill cells are guaranteed to be placed at the raster implied by origin at the glue box border and beyond. To ensure fill cell compatibility inside the tiling processor, it is sufficient to use the tile box as the glue box.

class CellMapping:
    r"""
    @brief A cell mapping (source to target layout)

    A cell mapping is an association of cells in two layouts forming pairs of cells, i.e. one cell corresponds to another cell in the other layout. The CellMapping object describes the mapping of cells of a source layout B to a target layout A. The cell mapping object is basically a table associating a cell in layout B with a cell in layout A.

    The cell mapping is of particular interest for providing the cell mapping recipe in \Cell#copy_tree_shapes or \Cell#move_tree_shapes.

    The mapping object is used to create and hold that table. There are three basic modes in which a table can be generated:

    @ul
      @li Top-level identity (\for_single_cell and \for_single_cell_full) @/li
      @li Top-level identify for multiple cells (\for_multi_cells_full and \for_multi_cells_full) @/li
      @li Geometrical identity (\from_geometry and \from_geometry_full)@/li
      @li Name identity (\from_names and \from_names_full) @/li
    @/ul

    'full' refers to the way cells are treated which are not mentioned. In the 'full' versions, cells for which no mapping is established explicitly - specifically all child cells in top-level identity modes - are created in the target layout and instantiated according to their source layout hierarchy. Then, these new cells become targets of the respective source cells. In the plain version (without 'full' cells), no additional cells are created. For the case of \Layout#copy_tree_shapes cells not explicitly mapped are flattened. Hence for example, \for_single_cell will flatten all children of the source cell during \Layout#copy_tree_shapes or \Layout#move_tree_shapes.

    Top-level identity means that only one cell (the top cell) is regarded identical. All child cells are not considered identical. In full mode (see below), this will create a new, identical cell tree below the top cell in layout A.

    Geometrical identity is defined by the exact identity of the set of expanded instances in each starting cell. Therefore, when a cell is mapped to another cell, shapes can be transferred from one cell to another while effectively rendering the same flat geometry (in the context of the given starting cells). Location identity is basically the safest way to map cells from one hierarchy into another, because it preserves the flat shape geometry. However in some cases the algorithm may find multiple mapping candidates. In that case it will make a guess about what mapping to choose.

    Name identity means that cells are identified by their names - for a source cell in layer B, a target cell with the same name is looked up in the target layout A and a mapping is created if a cell with the same name is found. However, name identity does not mean that the cells are actually equivalent because they may be placed differently. Hence, cell mapping by name is not a good choice when it is important to preserve the shape geometry of a layer.

    A cell might not be mapped to another cell which basically means that there is no corresponding cell. In this case, flattening to the next mapped cell is an option to transfer geometries despite the missing mapping. You can enforce a mapping by using the mapping generator methods in 'full' mode, i.e. \from_names_full or \from_geometry_full. These versions will create new cells and their corresponding instances in the target layout if no suitable target cell is found.

    This is a simple example for a cell mapping preserving the hierarchy of the source cell and creating a hierarchy copy in the top cell of the target layout ('hierarchical merge'):

    @code
    cell_names = [ "A", "B", "C" ]

    source = RBA::Layout::new
    source.read("input.gds")

    target = RBA::Layout::new
    target_top = target.create_cell("IMPORTED")

    cm = RBA::CellMapping::new
    # Copies the source layout hierarchy into the target top cell:
    cm.for_single_cell_full(target_top, source.top_cell)
    target.copy_tree_shapes(source, cm)
    @/code

    Without 'full', the effect is move-with-flattening (note we're using 'move' in this example):

    @code
    cell_names = [ "A", "B", "C" ]

    source = RBA::Layout::new
    source.read("input.gds")

    target = RBA::Layout::new
    target_top = target.create_cell("IMPORTED")

    cm = RBA::CellMapping::new
    # Flattens the source layout hierarchy into the target top cell:
    cm.for_single_cell(target_top, source.top_cell)
    target.move_tree_shapes(source, cm)
    @/code

    This is another example for using \CellMapping in multiple top cell identity mode. It extracts cells 'A', 'B' and 'C' from one layout and copies them to another. It will also copy all shapes and all child cells. Child cells which are shared between the three initial cells will be shared in the target layout too.

    @code
    cell_names = [ "A", "B", "C" ]

    source = RBA::Layout::new
    source.read("input.gds")

    target = RBA::Layout::new

    source_cells = cell_names.collect { |n| source.cell_by_name(n) }
    target_cells = cell_names.collect { |n| target.create_cell(n) }

    cm = RBA::CellMapping::new
    cm.for_multi_cells_full(target_cells, source_cells)
    target.copy_tree_shapes(source, cm)

class CompoundRegionOperationNode:

    @brief A base class for compound DRC operations

    This class is not intended to be used directly but rather provide a factory for various incarnations of compound operation nodes. Compound operations are a way to specify complex DRC operations put together by building a tree of operations. This operation tree then is executed with \Region#complex_op and will act on individual clusters of shapes and their interacting neighbors.

    A basic concept to the compound operations is the 'subject' (primary) and 'intruder' (secondary) input. The 'subject' is the Region, 'complex_op' with the operation tree is executed on. 'intruders' are regions inserted into the equation through secondary input nodes created with \new_secondary_node. The algorithm will execute the operation tree for every subject shape considering intruder shapes from the secondary inputs. The algorithm will only act on subject shapes primarily. As a consequence, 'lonely' intruder shapes without a subject shape are not considered at all. Only subject shapes trigger evaluation of the operation tree.

    The search distance for intruder shapes is determined by the operation and computed from the operation's requirements.

    NOTE: this feature is experimental and not deployed into the the DRC framework yet.

class Connectivity:
    r"""
    @brief This class specifies connections between different layers.
    Connections are build using \connect. There are basically two flavours of connections: intra-layer and inter-layer.

    Intra-layer connections make nets begin propagated along different shapes on the same net. Without the intra-layer connections, nets are not propagated over shape boundaries. As this is usually intended, intra-layer connections should always be specified for each layer.

    Inter-layer connections connect shapes on different layers. Shapes which touch across layers will be connected if their layers are specified as being connected through inter-layer \connect.

    All layers are specified in terms of layer indexes. Layer indexes are layout layer indexes (see \Layout class).

class CplxTrans:

    @brief A complex transformation

    A complex transformation provides magnification, mirroring at the x-axis, rotation by an arbitrary
    angle and a displacement. This is also the order, the operations are applied.
    This version can transform integer-coordinate objects into floating-point coordinate objects. This is the generic and exact case, for example for non-integer magnifications.

    Complex transformations are extensions of the simple transformation classes (\Trans or \DTrans in that case) and behave similar.

    Transformations can be used to transform points or other objects. Transformations can be combined with the '*' operator to form the transformation which is equivalent to applying the second and then the first. Here is some code:

    @code
    # Create a transformation that applies a magnification of 1.5, a rotation by 90 degree
    # and displacement of 10 in x and 20 units in y direction:
    t = RBA::DCplxTrans::new(1.5, 90, false, 10.0, 20.0)
    t.to_s            # r90 *1.5 10,20
    # compute the inverse:
    t.inverted.to_s   # r270 *0.666666667 -13,7
    # Combine with another displacement (applied after that):
    (RBA::DCplxTrans::new(5, 5) * t).to_s    # r90 *1.5 15,25
    # Transform a point:
    t.trans(RBA::DPoint::new(100, 200)).to_s # -290,170
    @/code

    The inverse type of the CplxTrans type is VCplxTrans which will transform floating-point to integer coordinate objects. Transformations of CplxTrans type can be concatenated (operator *) with either itself or with transformations of compatible input or output type. This means, the operator CplxTrans * ICplxTrans is allowed (output types of ICplxTrans and input of CplxTrans are identical) while CplxTrans * DCplxTrans is not.

    @brief A complex transformation

    A complex transformation provides magnification, mirroring at the x-axis, rotation by an arbitrary
    angle and a displacement. This is also the order, the operations are applied.

    A complex transformation provides a superset of the simple transformation.
    In many applications, a complex transformation computes floating-point coordinates to minimize rounding effects.
    This version can transform floating-point coordinate objects.

    Complex transformations are extensions of the simple transformation classes (\DTrans in that case) and behave similar.

    Transformations can be used to transform points or other objects. Transformations can be combined with the '*' operator to form the transformation which is equivalent to applying the second and then the first. Here is some code:

    @code
    # Create a transformation that applies a magnification of 1.5, a rotation by 90 degree
    # and displacement of 10 in x and 20 units in y direction:
    t = RBA::CplxTrans::new(1.5, 90, false, 10.0, 20.0)
    t.to_s            # r90 *1.5 10,20
    # compute the inverse:
    t.inverted.to_s   # r270 *0.666666667 -13,7
    # Combine with another displacement (applied after that):
    (RBA::CplxTrans::new(5, 5) * t).to_s    # r90 *1.5 15,25
    # Transform a point:
    t.trans(RBA::Point::new(100, 200)).to_s # -290,170

    @brief An edge pair (a pair of two edges)
    Edge pairs are objects representing two edges or parts of edges. They play a role mainly in the context of DRC functions, where they specify a DRC violation by connecting two edges which violate the condition checked. Within the framework of polygon and edge collections which provide DRC functionality, edges pairs with integer coordinates (\EdgePair type) are used in the form of edge pair collections (\EdgePairs).

    Edge pairs basically consist of two edges, called first and second. If created by a two-layer DRC function, the first edge will correspond to edges from the first layer and the second to edges from the second layer.

class DPolygon:
    r"""
    @brief A polygon class

    A polygon consists of an outer hull and zero to many
    holes. Each contour consists of several points. The point
    list is normalized such that the leftmost, lowest point is 
    the first one. The orientation is normalized such that
    the orientation of the hull contour is clockwise, while
    the orientation of the holes is counterclockwise.

    It is in no way checked that the contours are not overlapping.
    This must be ensured by the user of the object
    when filling the contours.

    A polygon can be asked for the number of holes using the \holes method. \each_point_hull delivers the points of the hull contour. \each_point_hole delivers the points of a specific hole. \each_edge delivers the edges (point-to-point connections) of both hull and holes. \bbox delivers the bounding box, \area the area and \perimeter the perimeter of the polygon.

    Here's an example of how to create a polygon:

    @code
    hull =  [ RBA::DPoint::new(0, 0),       RBA::DPoint::new(6000, 0),

    @brief A simple transformation

    Simple transformations only provide rotations about angles which a multiples of 90 degree.
    Together with the mirror options, this results in 8 distinct orientations (fixpoint transformations).
    These can be combined with a displacement which is applied after the rotation/mirror.
    This version acts on floating-point coordinates. A version for integer coordinates is \Trans.

    Here are some examples for using the DTrans class:

    @code
    t = RBA::DTrans::new(0, 100)  # displacement by 100 DBU in y direction
    # the inverse: -> "r0 0,-100"
    t.inverted.to_s
    # concatenation: -> "r90 -100,0"
    (RBA::DTrans::new(RBA::DTrans::R90) * t).to_s
    # apply to a point: -> "0,100"
    RBA::DTrans::new(RBA::DTrans::R90).trans(RBA::DPoint::new(100, 0))

        @brief Clears the breakout cells
        Breakout cells are a feature by which hierarchy handling can be disabled for specific cells. If cells are specified as breakout cells, they don't interact with neighbor or parent cells, hence are virtually isolated. Breakout cells are useful to shortcut hierarchy evaluation for cells which are otherwise difficult to handle. An example are memory array cells with overlaps to their neighbors: a precise handling of such cells would generate variants and the boundary of the array. Although precise, this behavior leads to partial flattening and propagation of shapes. In consequence, this will also result in wrong device detection in LVS applications. In such cases, these array cells can be declared 'breakout cells' which makes them isolated entities and variant generation does not happen.

    @brief A device extractor for a bipolar transistor (BJT)

    This class supplies the generic extractor for a bipolar transistor device.

    Extraction of vertical and lateral transistors is supported through a generic geometry model: The basic area is the base area. A marker shape must be provided for this area. The emitter of the transistor is defined by emitter layer shapes inside the base area. Multiple emitter shapes can be present. In this case, multiple transistor devices sharing the same base and collector are generated.
    Finally, a collector layer can be given. If non-empty, the parts inside the base region will define the collector terminals. If empty, the collector is formed by the substrate. In this case, the base region will be output to the 'tC' terminal output layer. This layer then needs to be connected to a global net to form the net connection.

    The device class produced by this extractor is \DeviceClassBJT3Transistor.

    @brief A device extractor for a four-terminal bipolar transistor (BJT)

    This class supplies the generic extractor for a bipolar transistor device.
    It is based on the \DeviceExtractorBJT3Transistor class with the extension of a substrate terminal and corresponding substrate terminal output (annotation) layer.

    Two new layers are introduced:

    @ul
    @li 'S' - the bulk (substrate) layer. Currently this layer is ignored and can be empty. @/li@li 'tS' - the bulk terminal output layer (defaults to 'S'). @/li@/ul

    The bulk terminal layer ('tS') can be an empty layer representing the wafer substrate.
    In this use mode the substrate terminal shapes will be produced on the 'tS' layer. This
    layer then needs to be connected to a global net to establish the net connection.

    @brief A device extractor for a three-terminal MOS transistor

    This class supplies the generic extractor for a MOS device.
    The device is defined by two basic input layers: the diffusion area
    (source and drain) and the gate area. It requires a third layer
    (poly) to put the gate terminals on. The separation between poly
    and allows separating the device recognition layer (gate) from the
    conductive layer.

    The device class produced by this extractor is \DeviceClassMOS3Transistor.

    The extractor delivers six parameters:

    @ul
    @li 'L' - the gate length in micrometer units @/li
    @li 'W' - the gate width in micrometer units @/li
    @li 'AS' and 'AD' - the source and drain region areas in square micrometers @/li
    @li 'PS' and 'PD' - the source and drain region perimeters in micrometer units @/li
    @/ul

    The device layer names are:

    @ul
    @li In strict mode: 'S' (source), 'D' (drain) and 'G' (gate). @/li
    @li In non-strict mode: 'SD' (source and drain) and 'G' (gate). @/li
    @/ul

    The terminals are output on these layers:
    @ul
    @li 'tS' - source. Default output is 'S' (strict mode) or 'SD' (otherwise). @/li
    @li 'tD' - drain. Default output is 'D' (strict mode) or 'SD' (otherwise). @/li
    @li 'tG' - gate. Default output is 'G'. @/li
    @/ul

    The source/drain (diffusion) area is distributed on the number of gates connecting to
    the particular source or drain area.

    This class is a closed one and methods cannot be reimplemented. To reimplement specific methods, see \DeviceExtractor.

    Edge pairs are objects representing two edges or parts of edges. They play a role mainly in the context of DRC functions, where they specify a DRC violation by connecting two edges which violate the condition checked. Within the framework of polygon and edge collections which provide DRC functionality, edges pairs are used in the form of edge pair collections (\EdgePairs).

    Edge pairs basically consist of two edges, called first and second. If created by a two-layer DRC function, the first edge will correspond to edges from the first layer and the second to edges from the second layer.

        @brief Merge the given polygons and specify the merge mode

        The wrapcount is computed over all polygons, i.e. overlapping polygons may "cancel" if they
        have different orientation (since a polygon is oriented by construction that is not easy to achieve).
        The other merge operation provided for this purpose is "merge" which normalizes each polygon individually before
        merging them. "simple_merge" is somewhat faster and consumes less memory.

        This method produces polygons and allows fine-tuning of the parameters for that purpose.

        a SimpleMerge operator and puts the result into an output vector.

        This method has been added in version 0.22.

        The mode specifies the rule to use when producing output. A value of 0 specifies the even-odd rule. A positive value specifies the wrap count threshold (positive only). A negative value specifies the threshold of the absolute value of the wrap count (i.e. -1 is non-zero rule).

class Edges(ShapeCollection):
    r"""
    @brief A collection of edges (Not necessarily describing closed contours)


    This class was introduced to simplify operations on edges sets. See \Edge for a description of the individual edge object. The edge collection contains an arbitrary number of edges and supports operations to select edges by various criteria, produce polygons from the edges by applying an extension, filtering edges against other edges collections and checking geometrical relations to other edges (DRC functionality).

    The edge collection is supposed to work closely with the \Region polygon set. Both are related, although the edge collection has a lower rank since it potentially represents a disconnected collection of edges. Edge collections may form closed contours, for example immediately after they have been derived from a polygon set using \Region#edges. But this state is volatile and can easily be destroyed by filtering edges. Hence the connected state does not play an important role in the edge collection's API.

    Edge collections may also contain points (degenerated edges with identical start and end points). Such point-like objects participate in some although not all methods of the edge collection class. 
    Edge collections can be used in two different flavors: in raw mode or merged semantics. With merged semantics (the default), connected edges are considered to belong together and are effectively merged.
    Overlapping parts are counted once in that mode. Dot-like edges are not considered in merged semantics.
    In raw mode (without merged semantics), each edge is considered as it is. Overlaps between edges
    may exists and merging has to be done explicitly using the \merge method. The semantics can be
    selected using \merged_semantics=.

        Starting with version 0.27, the method is called 'count' for consistency with \Region. 'size' is still provided as an alias.

class GenericDeviceExtractor(DeviceExtractorBase):
    r"""
    @brief The basic class for implementing custom device extractors.

    This class serves as a base class for implementing customized device extractors. This class does not provide any extraction functionality, so you have to implement every detail.

    Device extraction requires a few definitions. The definitions are made in the reimplementation of the \setup
    method. Required definitions to be made are:

    @ul
      @li The name of the extractor. This will also be the name of the device class produced by the extractor.       The name is set using \name=. @/li
      @li The device class of the devices to produce. The device class is registered using \register_device_class. @/li
      @li The layers used for the device extraction. These are input layers for the extraction as well as       output layers for defining the terminals. Terminals are the points at which the nets connect to the devices.
          Layers are defined using \define_layer. Initially, layers are abstract definitions with a name and a description.
          Concrete layers will be given when defining the connectivity. @/li
    @/ul

    When the device extraction is started, the device extraction algorithm will first ask the device extractor for the 'connectivity'. This is not a connectivity in a sense of electrical connections. The connectivity defines are logical compound that makes up the device. 'Connected' shapes are collected and presented to the device extractor.
    The connectivity is obtained by calling \get_connectivity. This method must be implemented to produce the connectivity.

    Finally, the individual devices need to be extracted. Each cluster of connected shapes is presented to the device extractor. A cluster may include more than one device. It's the device extractor's responsibility to extract the devices from this cluster and deliver the devices through \create_device. In addition, terminals have to be defined, so the net extractor can connect to the devices. Terminal definitions are made through \define_terminal. The device extraction is implemented in the \extract_devices method.

    If errors occur during device extraction, the \error method may be used to issue such errors. Errors reported this way are kept in the error log.

    This class has been introduced in version 0.26.

    @brief A complex transformation

    A complex transformation provides magnification, mirroring at the x-axis, rotation by an arbitrary
    angle and a displacement. This is also the order, the operations are applied.
    This version can transform integer-coordinate objects into the same, which may involve rounding and can be inexact.

    Complex transformations are extensions of the simple transformation classes (\Trans in that case) and behave similar.

    Transformations can be used to transform points or other objects. Transformations can be combined with the '*' operator to form the transformation which is equivalent to applying the second and then the first. Here is some code:

    @code
    # Create a transformation that applies a magnification of 1.5, a rotation by 90 degree
    # and displacement of 10 in x and 20 units in y direction:
    t = RBA::ICplxTrans::new(1.5, 90, false, 10.0, 20.0)
    t.to_s            # r90 *1.5 10,20
    # compute the inverse:
    t.inverted.to_s   # r270 *0.666666667 -13,7
    # Combine with another displacement (applied after that):
    (RBA::ICplxTrans::new(5, 5) * t).to_s    # r90 *1.5 15,25
    # Transform a point:
    t.trans(RBA::Point::new(100, 200)).to_s  # -290,170

    than the original.

    When the \Instance object is modified, the actual instance behind it is modified. The \Instance object acts as a simplified interface for single and array instances with or without properties.

class LEFDEFReaderConfiguration:

    @brief Detailed LEF/DEF reader options
    This class is a aggregate belonging to the \LoadLayoutOptions class. It provides options for the LEF/DEF reader. These options have been placed into a separate class to account for their complexity.
    This class specifically handles layer mapping. This is the process of generating layer names or GDS layer/datatypes from LEF/DEF layers and purpose combinations. There are basically two ways: to use a map file or to use pattern-based production rules.

    To use a layer map file, set the \map_file attribute to the name of the layer map file. The layer map file lists the GDS layer and datatype numbers to generate for the geometry.

    The pattern-based approach will use the layer name and attach a purpose-dependent suffix to it. Use the ..._suffix attributes to specify this suffix. For routing, the corresponding attribute is \routing_suffix for example. A purpose can also be mapped to a specific GDS datatype using the corresponding ..._datatype attributes.
    The decorated or undecorated names are looked up in a layer mapping table in the next step. The layer mapping table is specified using the \layer_map attribute. This table can be used to map layer names to specific GDS layers by using entries of the form 'NAME: layer-number'.

    If a layer map file is present, the pattern-based attributes are ignored.

    @brief A structure encapsulating the layer properties

    The layer properties describe how a layer is stored in a GDS2 or OASIS file for example. The \LayerInfo object represents the storage properties that are attached to a layer in the database.

    In general, a layer has either a layer and a datatype number (in GDS2), a name (for example in DXF or CIF) or both (in OASIS). In the latter case, the primary identification is through layer and datatype number and the name is some annotation attached to it. A \LayerInfo object which specifies just a name returns true on \is_named?.
    The \LayerInfo object can also specify an anonymous layer (use \LayerInfo#new without arguments). Such a layer will not be stored when saving the layout. They can be employed for temporary layers for example. Use \LayerInfo#anonymous? to test whether a layer does not have a specification.

    The \LayerInfo is used for example in \Layout#insert_layer to specify the properties of the new layer that will be created. The \is_equivalent? method compares two \LayerInfo objects using the layer and datatype numbers with a higher priority over the name.

class LayerMap:
    r"""
    @brief An object representing an arbitrary mapping of physical layers to logical layers

    "Physical" layers are stream layers or other separated layers in a CAD file. "Logical" layers are the layers present in a \Layout object. Logical layers are represented by an integer index while physical layers are given by a layer and datatype number or name. A logical layer is created automatically in the layout on reading if it does not exist yet.

    The mapping describes an association of a set of physical layers to a set of logical ones, where multiple
    physical layers can be mapped to a single logical one, which effectively merges the layers.

    For each logical layer, a target layer can be specified. A target layer is the layer/datatype/name combination
    as which the logical layer appears in the layout. By using a target layer different from the source layer
    renaming a layer can be achieved while loading a layout. Another use case for that feature is to assign
    layer names to GDS layer/datatype combinations which are numerical only.

    LayerMap objects are used in two ways: as input for the reader (inside a \LoadLayoutOptions class) and
    as output from the reader (i.e. Layout::read method). For layer map objects used as input, the layer indexes
    (logical layers) can be consecutive numbers. They do not need to correspond with real layer indexes from
    a layout object. When used as output, the layer map's logical layers correspond to the layer indexes inside
    the layout that the layer map was used upon.

    This is a sample how to use the LayerMap object. It maps all datatypes of layers 1, 2 and 3 to datatype 0 and
    assigns the names 'ONE', 'TWO' and 'THREE' to these layout layers:

    @codelm = RBA::LayerMap::new
    lm.map("1/0-255 : ONE (1/0)")
    lm.map("2/0-255 : TWO (2/0)")
    lm.map("3/0-255 : THREE (3/0)")

    # read the layout using the layer map
    lo = RBA::LoadLayoutOptions::new
    lo.layer_map.assign(lm)
    ly = RBA::Layout::new
    ly.read("input.gds", lo)
    @/code

    1:n mapping is supported: a physical layer can be mapped to multiple logical layers using 'mmap' instead of 'map'. When using this variant, mapping acts additive.
    The following example will map layer 1, datatypes 0 to 255 to logical layer 0, and layer 1, datatype 17 to logical layers 0 plus 1:
    @codelm = RBA::LayerMap::new
    lm.map("1/0-255", 0)   # (can be 'mmap' too)
    lm.mmap("1/17", 1)
    @/code

    'unmapping' allows removing a mapping. This allows creating 'holes' in mapping ranges. The following example maps layer 1, datatypes 0 to 16 and 18 to 255 to logical layer 0:
    @codelm = RBA::LayerMap::new
    lm.map("1/0-255", 0)
    lm.unmap("1/17")

        @param map_expr The string describing the physical layer to map.
        @param log_layer The logical layer to which the physical layers are mapped.

        The string expression is constructed using the syntax: 
        "list[/list][;..]" for layer/datatype pairs. "list" is a 
        sequence of numbers, separated by comma values or a range 
        separated by a hyphen. Examples are: "1/2", "1-5/0", "1,2,5/0",
        "1/5;5/6".

        layer/datatype wildcards can be specified with "*". When "*" is used
        for the upper limit, it is equivalent to "all layer above". When used
        alone, it is equivalent to "all layers". Examples: "1 / *", "* / 10-*"

        Named layers are specified simply by specifying the name, if
        necessary in single or double quotes (if the name begins with a digit or
        contains non-word characters). layer/datatype and name descriptions can
        be mixed, i.e. "AA;1/5" (meaning: name "AA" or layer 1/datatype 5).

        A target layer can be specified with the ":<target>" notation, where
        target is a valid string for a LayerProperties() object.

        A target can include relative layer/datatype specifications and wildcards.
        For example, "1-10/0: *+1/0" will add 1 to the original layer number.
        "1-10/0-50: * / *" will use the original layers.

        If the logical layer is negative or omitted, the method will select the next available one.

    @brief A layer mapping (source to target layout)

    A layer mapping is an association of layers in two layouts forming pairs of layers, i.e. one layer corresponds to another layer in the other layout. The LayerMapping object describes the mapping of layers of a source layout A to a target layout B.

    A layer mapping can be set up manually or using the methods \create or \create_full.

    @code
    lm = RBA::LayerMapping::new
    # explicit:
    lm.map(2, 1)  # map layer index 2 of source to 1 of target
    lm.map(7, 3)  # map layer index 7 of source to 3 of target
    ...
    # or employing the specification identity:
    lm.create(target_layout, source_layout)
    # plus creating layers which don't exist in the target layout yet:
    new_layers = lm.create_full(target_layout, source_layout)
    @/code

    A layer might not be mapped to another layer which basically means that there is no corresponding layer.
    Such layers will be ignored in operations using the layer mapping. Use \create_full to ensure all layers
    of the source layout are mapped.

    LayerMapping objects play a role mainly in the hierarchical copy or move operations of \Layout. However, use is not restricted to these applications.

    @brief The layout object

    This object represents a layout.
    The layout object contains the cell hierarchy and
    adds functionality for managing cell names and layer names.
    The cell hierarchy can be changed by adding cells and cell instances.
    Cell instances will virtually put the content of a cell into another cell. Many cell instances can be put into a cell thus forming repetitions of the cell content. This process can be repeated over multiple levels. In effect a cell graphs is created with parent cells and child cells. The graph must not be recursive, so there is at least one top cell, which does not have a parent cell. Multiple top cells can be present.

    \Layout is the very basic class of the layout database. It has a rich set of methods to manipulate and query the layout hierarchy, the geometrical objects, the meta information and other features of the layout database. For a discussion of the basic API and the related classes see @<a href="/programming/database_api.xml">The Database API@</a>.

    Usually layout objects have already been created by KLayout's application core. You can address such a layout via the \CellView object inside the \LayoutView class. For example:

    cell = layout.create_cell("TOP")
    layer = layout.layer(RBA::LayerInfo::new(1, 0))

        This state is cancelled by the \end_changes method.
        The start_changes method can be called multiple times
        and must be cancelled the same number of times.

        This method can be used to speed up certain operations. For example iterating over the layout with a \RecursiveShapeIterator while modifying other layers of the layout can be very inefficient, because inside the loop the layout's state is invalidate and updated frequently.
        Putting a update and start_changes sequence before the loop (use both methods in that order!) and a end_changes call after the loop can improve the performance dramatically.

        In addition, it can be necessary to prevent redraw operations in certain cases by using start_changes .. end_changes, in particular when it is possible to put a layout object into an invalid state temporarily.

        While the layout is under construction \update can be called to update the internal state explicitly if required.

class LayoutMetaInfo:
    r"""
    @brief A piece of layout meta information
    Layout meta information is basically additional data that can be attached to a layout. Layout readers may generate meta information and some writers will add layout information to the layout object. Some writers will also read meta information to determine certain attributes.

    Multiple layout meta information objects can be attached to one layout using \Layout#add_meta_info. Meta information is identified by a unique name and carries a string value plus an optional description string. The description string is for information only and is not evaluated by code.

    Meta information can be attached to the layout object and to cells. It is similar to user properties. The differences are:

    @ul
    @li Meta information is stored differently in GDS and OASIS files using the context information added     by KLayout to annotated PCell or library cells too. Hence meta information does not pollute     the standard user properties space. @/li
    @li The value of meta information can be complex serializable types such as lists, hashes and elementary     objects such as \Box or \DBox. Scalar types include floats and booleans. @/li
    @li Meta information keys are strings and are supported also for GDS which only accepts integer number     keys for user properties. @/li
    @/ul

    Elementary (serializable) objects are: \Box, \DBox, \Edge, \DEdge, \EdgePair, \DEdgePair, \EdgePairs, \Edges, \LayerProperties, \Matrix2d, \Matrix3d, \Path, \DPath, \Point, \DPoint, \Polygon, \DPolygon, \SimplePolygon, \DSimplePolygon, \Region, \Text, \DText, \Texts, \Trans, \DTrans, \CplxTrans, \ICplxTrans, \DCplxTrans, \VCplxTrans, \Vector, \DVector (list may not be complete).

    KLayout itself also generates meta information with specific keys. For disambiguation, namespaces can be established by prefixing the key strings with some unique identifier in XML fashion, like a domain name - e.g. 'example.com:key'.

    @b Note: @/b only meta information marked with \is_persisted? == true is stored in GDS or OASIS files. This is not the default setting, so you need to explicitly set that flag.

    See also \Layout#each_meta_info, \Layout#meta_info_value, \Layout#meta_info and \Layout#remove_meta_info as well as the corresponding \Cell methods.

    An example of how to attach persisted meta information to a cell is here:

    @code
    ly = RBA::Layout::new
    c1 = ly.create_cell("C1")

    mi = RBA::LayoutMetaInfo::new("the-answer", 42.0)
    mi.persisted = true
    c1.add_meta_info(mi)

    # will now hold this piece of meta information attached to cell 'C1':
    ly.write("to.gds")

class LayoutQuery:
    r"""
    @brief A layout query
    Layout queries are the backbone of the "Search & replace" feature. Layout queries allow retrieval of data from layouts and manipulation of layouts. This object provides script binding for this feature.
    Layout queries are used by first creating a query object. Depending on the nature of the query, either \execute or \each can be used to execute the query. \execute will run the query and return once the query is finished. \execute is useful for running queries that don't return results such as "delete" or "with ... do" queries.
    \each can be used when the results of the query need to be retrieved.

    The \each method will call a block a of code for every result available. It will provide a \LayoutQueryIterator object that allows accessing the results of the query. Depending on the query, different attributes of the iterator object will be available. For example, "select" queries will fill the "data" attribute with an array of values corresponding to the columns of the selection.

    Here is some sample code:
    @code
    ly = RBA::CellView::active.layout
    q = RBA::LayoutQuery::new("select cell.name, cell.bbox from *")
    q.each(ly) do |iter|

class LayoutToNetlist:
    r"""
    @brief A generic framework for extracting netlists from layouts

    This class wraps various concepts from db::NetlistExtractor and db::NetlistDeviceExtractor
    and more. It is supposed to provide a framework for extracting a netlist from a layout.

    The use model of this class consists of five steps which need to be executed in this order.

    @ul
    @li Configuration: in this step, the LayoutToNetlist object is created and
        if required, configured. Methods to be used in this step are \threads=,
        \area_ratio= or \max_vertex_count=. The constructor for the LayoutToNetlist
        object receives a \RecursiveShapeIterator object which basically supplies the
        hierarchy and the layout taken as input.
    @/li
    @li Preparation
        In this step, the device recognition and extraction layers are drawn from
        the framework. Derived can now be computed using boolean operations.
        Methods to use in this step are \make_layer and its variants.
        Layer preparation is not necessarily required to happen before all
        other steps. Layers can be computed shortly before they are required.
    @/li
    @li Following the preparation, the devices can be extracted using \extract_devices.
        This method needs to be called for each device extractor required. Each time,
        a device extractor needs to be given plus a map of device layers. The device
        layers are device extractor specific. Either original or derived layers
        may be specified here. Layer preparation may happen between calls to \extract_devices.
    @/li
    @li Once the devices are derived, the netlist connectivity can be defined and the
        netlist extracted. The connectivity is defined with \connect and its
        flavours. The actual netlist extraction happens with \extract_netlist.
    @/li
    @li After netlist extraction, the information is ready to be retrieved.
        The produced netlist is available with \netlist. The Shapes of a
        specific net are available with \shapes_of_net. \probe_net allows
        finding a net by probing a specific location.
    @/li
    @/ul

    You can also use the extractor with an existing \DeepShapeStore object or even flat data. In this case, preparation means importing existing regions with the \register method.
    If you want to use the \LayoutToNetlist object with flat data, use the 'LayoutToNetlist(topcell, dbu)' constructor. If you want to use it with hierarchical data and an existing DeepShapeStore object, use the 'LayoutToNetlist(dss)' constructor.

    This class has been introduced in version 0.26.

        @brief Runs an antenna check on the extracted clusters

        The antenna check will traverse all clusters and run an antenna check
        for all root clusters. The antenna ratio is defined by the total
        area of all "metal" shapes divided by the total area of all "gate" shapes
        on the cluster. Of all clusters where the antenna ratio is larger than
        the limit ratio all metal shapes are copied to the output region as
        error markers.

        The simple call is:

        @code
        l2n = ... # a LayoutToNetlist object
        l2n.extract_netlist
        # check for antenna ratio 10.0 of metal vs. poly:
        errors = l2n.antenna(poly, metal, 10.0)
        @/code

        You can include diodes which rectify the antenna effect. Provide recognition layers for theses diodes and include them in the connections. Then specify the diode layers in the antenna call:

        @code
        ...
        # include diode_layer1:
        errors = l2n.antenna(poly, metal, 10.0, [ diode_layer1 ])
        # include diode_layer1 and diode_layer2:errors = l2n.antenna(poly, metal, 10.0, [ diode_layer1, diode_layer2 ])
        @/code

        Diodes can be configured to partially reduce the antenna effect depending on their area. This will make the diode_layer1 increase the ratio by 50.0 per square micrometer area of the diode:

        @code
        ...
        # diode_layer1 increases the ratio by 50 per square micrometer area:
        errors = l2n.antenna(poly, metal, 10.0 [ [ diode_layer, 50.0 ] ])
        @/code

        If 'texts' is non-nil, this text collection will receive labels explaining the error in terms of area values and relevant ratio.

        This method copies all nets into cells corresponding to the circuits. It uses the 'cmap'

        If no mapping is provided for a specific circuit cell, the nets are copied into the next mapped parent as many times as the circuit cell appears there (circuit flattening).

    All geometry in the MAG file will first be scaled to \mag_lambda and is then brought to the database unit.

class NetTracer:
    r"""
    @brief The net tracer feature

    The net tracer class provides an interface to the net tracer feature. It is accompanied by the \NetElement and \NetTracerTechnology classes. The latter will provide the technology definition for the net tracer while the \NetElement objects represent a piece of the net after it has been extracted.

    The technology definition is optional. The net tracer can be used with a predefined technology as well. The basic scheme of using the net tracer is to instantiate a net tracer object and run the extraction through the \NetTracer#trace method. After this method was executed successfully, the resulting net can be obtained from the net tracer object by iterating over the \NetElement objects of the net tracer.

    Here is some sample code:

    @code
    ly = RBA::CellView::active.layout

    tracer = RBA::NetTracer::new

    tech = RBA::NetTracerConnectivity::new
    tech.connection("1/0", "2/0", "3/0")

    tracer.trace(tech, ly, ly.top_cell, RBA::Point::new(7000, 1500), ly.find_layer(1, 0))

    tracer.each_element do |e|
      puts e.shape.polygon.transformed(e.trans)
    end
    @/code

    This class has been introduced in version 0.25. With version 0.28, the \NetTracerConnectivity class replaces the 'NetTracerTechnology' class.

    Set this value to limit the maximum number of shapes delivered. Upon reaching this count, the tracer will stop and report the net as 'incomplete' (see \incomplete?).
    Setting a trace depth if 0 is equivalent to 'unlimited'.
    The actual number of shapes delivered may be a little less than the depth because of internal marker shapes which are taken into account, but are not delivered.

class NetlistComparer:
    r"""
    @brief Compares two netlists
    This class performs a comparison of two netlists.
    It can be used with an event receiver (logger) to track the errors and net mismatches. Event receivers are derived from class \GenericNetlistCompareLogger.
    The netlist comparer can be configured in different ways. Specific hints can be given for nets, device classes or circuits to improve efficiency and reliability of the graph equivalence deduction algorithm. For example, objects can be marked as equivalent using \same_nets, \same_circuits etc. The compare algorithm will then use these hints to derive further equivalences. This way, ambiguities can be resolved.

    Another configuration option relates to swappable pins of subcircuits. If pins are marked this way, the compare algorithm may swap them to achieve net matching. Swappable pins belong to an 'equivalence group' and can be defined with \equivalent_pins.

    This class has been introduced in version 0.26.

    @brief Represents the identity mapping between the objects of two netlists.

    The NetlistCrossReference object is a container for the results of a netlist comparison. It implemented the \NetlistCompareLogger interface, hence can be used as output for a netlist compare operation (\NetlistComparer#compare). It's purpose is to store the results of the compare. It is used in this sense inside the \LayoutVsSchematic framework.

    The basic idea of the cross reference object is pairing: the netlist comparer will try to identify matching items and store them as pairs inside the cross reference object. If no match is found, a single-sided pair is generated: one item is nil in this case.
    Beside the items, a status is kept which gives more details about success or failure of the match operation.

    Item pairing happens on different levels, reflecting the hierarchy of the netlists. On the top level there are circuits. Inside circuits nets, devices, subcircuits and pins are paired. Nets further contribute their connected items through terminals (for devices), pins (outgoing) and subcircuit pins.

class NetlistSpiceReader(NetlistReader):

    @brief Implements a netlist Reader for the SPICE format.
    Use the SPICE reader like this:

    @code
    reader = RBA::NetlistSpiceReader::new
    netlist = RBA::Netlist::new
    netlist.read(path, reader)
    @/code

    The translation of SPICE elements can be tailored by providing a \NetlistSpiceReaderDelegate class. This allows translating of device parameters and mapping of some subcircuits to devices.

    The following example is a delegate that turns subcircuits called HVNMOS and HVPMOS into MOS4 devices with the parameters scaled by 1.5:

    @code
    class MyDelegate < RBA::NetlistSpiceReaderDelegate

      # says we want to catch these subcircuits as devices
      def wants_subcircuit(name)
        name == "HVNMOS" || name == "HVPMOS"
      end

      # translate the element
      def element(circuit, el, name, model, value, nets, params)

        if el != "X"
          # all other elements are left to the standard implementation
          return super
        end

        if nets.size != 4
          error("Subcircuit #{model} needs four nodes")
        end

        # provide a device class
        cls = circuit.netlist.device_class_by_name(model)
        if ! cls
          cls = RBA::DeviceClassMOS4Transistor::new
          cls.name = model
          circuit.netlist.add(cls)
        end

        # create a device
        device = circuit.create_device(cls, name)

        # and configure the device
        [ "S", "G", "D", "B" ].each_with_index do |t,index|
          device.connect_terminal(t, nets[index])
        end
        params.each do |p,value|
          device.set_parameter(p, value * 1.5)
        end

      end

    end

    # usage:

    mydelegate = MyDelegate::new
    reader = RBA::NetlistSpiceReader::new(mydelegate)

    nl = RBA::Netlist::new
    nl.read(input_file, reader)
    @/code

    A somewhat contrived example for using the delegate to translate net names is this:

    @code
    class MyDelegate < RBA::NetlistSpiceReaderDelegate

      # translates 'VDD' to 'VXX' and leave all other net names as is:
      alias translate_net_name_org translate_net_name
      def translate_net_name(n)
        return n == "VDD" ? "VXX" : translate_net_name_org(n)}
      end

class NetlistSpiceWriter(NetlistWriter):
    r"""
    @brief Implements a netlist writer for the SPICE format.
    Provide a delegate for customizing the way devices are written.

    Use the SPICE writer like this:

    @code
    writer = RBA::NetlistSpiceWriter::new
    netlist.write(path, writer)
    @/code

    You can give a custom description for the headline:

    @code
    writer = RBA::NetlistSpiceWriter::new
    netlist.write(path, writer, "A custom description")
    @/code

    To customize the output, you can use a device writer delegate.
    The delegate is an object of a class derived from \NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate which reimplements several methods to customize the following parts:

    @ul
    @li A global header (\NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate#write_header): this method is called to print the part right after the headline @/li
    @li A per-device class header (\NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate#write_device_intro): this method is called for every device class and may print device-class specific headers (e.g. model definitions) @/li
    @li Per-device output: this method (\NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate#write_device): this method is called for every device and may print the device statement(s) in a specific way. @/li
    @/ul

    The delegate must use \NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate#emit_line to print a line, \NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate#emit_comment to print a comment etc.
    For more method see \NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate.

    A sample with a delegate is this:

    @code
    class MyDelegate < RBA::NetlistSpiceWriterDelegate

      def write_header
        emit_line("*** My special header")
      end

      def write_device_intro(cls)
        emit_comment("My intro for class " + cls.name)
      end

      def write_device(dev)
        if dev.device_class.name != "MYDEVICE"
          emit_comment("Terminal #1: " + net_to_string(dev.net_for_terminal(0)))
          emit_comment("Terminal #2: " + net_to_string(dev.net_for_terminal(1)))
          super(dev)
          emit_comment("After device " + dev.expanded_name)
        else
          super(dev)
        end
      end

    end

    # write the netlist with delegate:
    writer = RBA::NetlistSpiceWriter::new(MyDelegate::new)
    netlist.write(path, writer)

    @li Layers: the layers the PCell wants to create @/li

class ParentInstArray:

    @brief A parent instance

    A parent instance is basically an inverse instance: instead of pointing
    to the child cell, it is pointing to the parent cell and the transformation
    is representing the shift of the parent cell relative to the child cell.
    For memory performance, a parent instance is not stored as a instance but
    rather as a reference to a child instance and a reference to the cell which
    is the parent.
    The parent instance itself is computed on the fly. It is representative for
    a set of instances belonging to the same cell index. The special parent instance
    iterator takes care of producing the right sequence (\Cell#each_parent_inst).

    See @<a href="/programming/database_api.xml">The Database API@</a> for more details about the database objects.

class Polygon:
    r"""
    @brief A polygon class

    A polygon consists of an outer hull and zero to many
    holes. Each contour consists of several points. The point
    list is normalized such that the leftmost, lowest point is 
    the first one. The orientation is normalized such that
    the orientation of the hull contour is clockwise, while
    the orientation of the holes is counterclockwise.

    It is in no way checked that the contours are not overlapping.
    This must be ensured by the user of the object
    when filling the contours.

    A polygon can be asked for the number of holes using the \holes method. \each_point_hull delivers the points of the hull contour. \each_point_hole delivers the points of a specific hole. \each_edge delivers the edges (point-to-point connections) of both hull and holes. \bbox delivers the bounding box, \area the area and \perimeter the perimeter of the polygon.

    Here's an example of how to create a polygon:

    @code
    hull =  [ RBA::Point::new(0, 0),       RBA::Point::new(6000, 0),

class RecursiveInstanceIterator:
    r"""
    @brief An iterator delivering instances recursively

    The iterator can be obtained from a cell and optionally a region.
    It simplifies retrieval of instances while considering
    subcells as well.
    Some options can be specified in addition, i.e. the hierarchy level to which to look into.
    The search can be confined to instances of certain cells (see \targets=) or to certain regions. Subtrees can be selected for traversal or excluded from it (see \select_cells).

    This is some sample code:

    @code
    # prints the effective instances of cell "A" as seen from the initial cell "cell"
    iter = cell.begin_instances_rec
    iter.targets = "A"
    while !iter.at_end?
      puts "Instance of #{iter.inst_cell.name} in #{cell.name}: " + (iter.dtrans * iter.inst_dtrans).to_s
      iter.next
    end

    # or shorter:
    cell.begin_instances_rec.each do |iter|
      puts "Instance of #{iter.inst_cell.name} in #{cell.name}: " + (iter.dtrans * iter.inst_dtrans).to_s
    end
    @/code

    Here, a target cell is specified which confines the search to instances of this particular cell.
    'iter.dtrans' gives us the accumulated transformation of all parents up to the top cell. 'iter.inst_dtrans' gives us the transformation from the current instance. 'iter.inst_cell' finally gives us the target cell of the current instance (which is always 'A' in our case).

    \Cell offers three methods to get these iterators: begin_instances_rec, begin_instances_rec_touching and begin_instances_rec_overlapping.
    \Cell#begin_instances_rec will deliver a standard recursive instance iterator which starts from the given cell and iterates over all child cells. \Cell#begin_instances_rec_touching creates a RecursiveInstanceIterator which delivers the instances whose bounding boxed touch the given search box. \Cell#begin_instances_rec_overlapping gives an iterator which delivers all instances whose bounding box overlaps the search box.

    A RecursiveInstanceIterator object can also be created directly, like this:

    @code
    iter = RBA::RecursiveInstanceIterator::new(layout, cell [, options ])
    @/code

    "layout" is the layout object, "cell" the \Cell object of the initial cell.

    The recursive instance iterator can be confined to a maximum hierarchy depth. By using \max_depth=, the iterator will restrict the search depth to the given depth in the cell tree.
    In the same way, the iterator can be configured to start from a certain hierarchy depth using \min_depth=. The hierarchy depth always applies to the parent of the instances iterated.

    In addition, the recursive instance iterator supports selection and exclusion of subtrees. For that purpose it keeps flags per cell telling it for which cells to turn instance delivery on and off. The \select_cells method sets the "start delivery" flag while \unselect_cells sets the "stop delivery" flag. In effect, using \unselect_cells will exclude that cell plus the subtree from delivery. Parts of that subtree can be turned on again using \select_cells. For the cells selected that way, the instances of these cells and their child cells are delivered, even if their parent was unselected.

    To get instances from a specific cell, i.e. "MACRO" plus its child cells, unselect the top cell first and the select the desired cell again:

    @code
    # deliver all instances inside "MACRO" and the sub-hierarchy:
    iter = RBA::RecursiveInstanceIterator::new(layout, cell)
    iter.unselect_cells(cell.cell_index)
    iter.select_cells("MACRO")
    ...
    @/code

    The \unselect_all_cells and \select_all_cells methods turn on the "stop" and "start" flag for all cells respectively. If you use \unselect_all_cells and use \select_cells for a specific cell, the iterator will deliver only the instances of the selected cell, not its children. Those are still unselected by \unselect_all_cells:

    @code
    # deliver all instance inside "MACRO" but not of child cells:
    iter = RBA::RecursiveInstanceIterator::new(layout, cell)
    iter.unselect_all_cells
    iter.select_cells("MACRO")
    ...
    @/code

    Cell selection is done using cell indexes or glob pattern. Glob pattern are equivalent to the usual file name wildcards used on various command line shells. For example "A*" matches all cells starting with an "A". The curly brace notation and character classes are supported as well. For example "C{125,512}" matches "C125" and "C512" and "[ABC]*" matches all cells starting with an "A", a "B" or "C". "[^ABC]*" matches all cells not starting with one of that letters.

    To confine instance iteration to instances of certain cells, use the \targets feature:

    @code
    # deliver all instance of "INV1":
    iter = RBA::RecursiveInstanceIterator::new(layout, cell)
    iter.targets = "INV1"
    ...
    @/code

    Targets can be specified either as lists of cell indexes or through a glob pattern.

    Instances are always delivered depth-first with child instances before their parents. A default recursive instance iterator will first deliver leaf cells, followed by the parent of these cells.

    When a search region is used, instances whose bounding box touch or overlap (depending on 'overlapping' flag) will be reported. The instance bounding box taken as reference is computed using all layers of the layout.

    The iterator will deliver the individual elements of instance arrays, confined to the search region if one is given. Consequently the return value (\current_inst_element) is an \InstElement object which is basically a combination of an \Instance object and information about the current array element.
    \inst_cell, \inst_trans and \inst_dtrans are methods provided for convenience to access the current array member's transformation and the target cell of the current instance.

    The RecursiveInstanceIterator class has been introduced in version 0.27.

class RecursiveShapeIterator:
    r"""
    @brief An iterator delivering shapes recursively

    The iterator can be obtained from a cell, a layer and optionally a region.
    It simplifies retrieval of shapes from a geometrical region while considering
    subcells as well.
    Some options can be specified in addition, i.e. the level to which to look into or
    shape classes and shape properties. The shapes are retrieved by using the \shape method,
    \next moves to the next shape and \at_end tells, if the iterator has move shapes to deliver.

    This is some sample code:

    @code
    # print the polygon-like objects as seen from the initial cell "cell"
    iter = cell.begin_shapes_rec(layer)
    while !iter.at_end?
      if iter.shape.renders_polygon?
        polygon = iter.shape.polygon.transformed(iter.itrans)
        puts "In cell #{iter.cell.name}: " + polygon.to_s
      end
      iter.next
    end

    # or shorter:
    cell.begin_shapes_rec(layer).each do |iter|
      if iter.shape.renders_polygon?
        polygon = iter.shape.polygon.transformed(iter.itrans)
        puts "In cell #{iter.cell.name}: " + polygon.to_s
      end
    end
    @/code

    \Cell offers three methods to get these iterators: begin_shapes_rec, begin_shapes_rec_touching and begin_shapes_rec_overlapping.
    \Cell#begin_shapes_rec will deliver a standard recursive shape iterator which starts from the given cell and iterates over all child cells. \Cell#begin_shapes_rec_touching delivers a RecursiveShapeIterator which delivers the shapes whose bounding boxed touch the given search box. \Cell#begin_shapes_rec_overlapping delivers all shapes whose bounding box overlaps the search box.

    A RecursiveShapeIterator object can also be created explicitly. This allows some more options, i.e. using multiple layers. A multi-layer recursive shape iterator can be created like this:

    @code
    iter = RBA::RecursiveShapeIterator::new(layout, cell, [ layer_index1, layer_index2 .. ])
    @/code

    "layout" is the layout object, "cell" the RBA::Cell object of the initial cell. layer_index1 etc. are the layer indexes of the layers to get the shapes from. While iterating, \RecursiveShapeIterator#layer delivers the layer index of the current shape.

    The recursive shape iterator can be confined to a maximum hierarchy depth. By using \max_depth=, the iterator will restrict the search depth to the given depth in the cell tree.

    In addition, the recursive shape iterator supports selection and exclusion of subtrees. For that purpose it keeps flags per cell telling it for which cells to turn shape delivery on and off. The \select_cells method sets the "start delivery" flag while \unselect_cells sets the "stop delivery" flag. In effect, using \unselect_cells will exclude that cell plus the subtree from delivery. Parts of that subtree can be turned on again using \select_cells. For the cells selected that way, the shapes of these cells and their child cells are delivered, even if their parent was unselected.

    To get shapes from a specific cell, i.e. "MACRO" plus its child cells, unselect the top cell first and the select the desired cell again:

    @code
    # deliver all shapes inside "MACRO" and the sub-hierarchy:
    iter = RBA::RecursiveShapeIterator::new(layout, cell, layer)
    iter.unselect_cells(cell.cell_index)
    iter.select_cells("MACRO")
    @/code

    Note that if "MACRO" uses library cells for example which are used otherwise as well, the iterator will only deliver the shapes for those instances belonging to "MACRO" (directly or indirectly), not those for other instances of these library cells.

    The \unselect_all_cells and \select_all_cells methods turn on the "stop" and "start" flag for all cells respectively. If you use \unselect_all_cells and use \select_cells for a specific cell, the iterator will deliver only the shapes of the selected cell, not its children. Those are still unselected by \unselect_all_cells:

    @code
    # deliver all shapes of "MACRO" but not of child cells:
    iter = RBA::RecursiveShapeIterator::new(layout, cell, layer)
    iter.unselect_all_cells
    iter.select_cells("MACRO")
    @/code

    Cell selection is done using cell indexes or glob pattern. Glob pattern are equivalent to the usual file name wildcards used on various command line shells. For example "A*" matches all cells starting with an "A". The curly brace notation and character classes are supported as well. For example "C{125,512}" matches "C125" and "C512" and "[ABC]*" matches all cells starting with an "A", a "B" or "C". "[^ABC]*" matches all cells not starting with one of that letters.

class Region(ShapeCollection):
    r"""
    @brief A region (a potentially complex area consisting of multiple polygons)


    This class was introduced to simplify operations on polygon sets like boolean or sizing operations. Regions consist of many polygons and thus are a generalization of single polygons which describes a single coherence set of points. Regions support a variety of operations and have several states. 

    The region's state can be empty (does not contain anything) or box-like, i.e. the region consists of a single box. In that case, some operations can be simplified. Regions can have merged state. In merged state, regions consist of merged (non-touching, non-self overlapping) polygons. Each polygon describes one coherent area in merged state.

    The preferred representation of polygons inside the region are polygons with holes.

    Regions are always expressed in database units. If you want to use regions from different database unit domains, scale the regions accordingly, i.e. by using the \transformed method.


    Regions provide convenient operators for the boolean operations. Hence it is often no longer required to work with the \EdgeProcessor class. For example:

    @code
    r1 = RBA::Region::new(RBA::Box::new(0, 0, 100, 100))
    r2 = RBA::Region::new(RBA::Box::new(20, 20, 80, 80))
    # compute the XOR:
    r1_xor_r2 = r1 ^ r2
    @/code

    Regions can be used in two different flavors: in raw mode or merged semantics. With merged semantics (the default), connected polygons are considered to belong together and are effectively merged.
    Overlapping areas are counted once in that mode. Internal edges (i.e. arising from cut lines) are not considered.
    In raw mode (without merged semantics), each polygon is considered as it is. Overlaps between polygons
    may exists and merging has to be done explicitly using the \merge method. The semantics can be
    selected using \merged_semantics=.

        'area_ratio' and 'max_vertex' supply two optimization parameters which control how big polygons are split to reduce the region's polygon complexity.

        The transformation is useful to scale to a specific database unit for example.

        @param shape_iterator The recursive shape iterator which delivers the hierarchy to take
        @param deep_shape_store The hierarchical heap (see there)
        @param area_ratio The maximum ratio of bounding box to polygon area before polygons are split
        @param trans The transformation to apply when storing the layout data

        This method has been introduced in version 0.26.

The area ratio is supposed to render polygons whose bounding box is a better approximation. This applies for example to 'L' shape polygons.

        If "whole_edges" is true, the resulting \EdgePairs collection will receive the whole edges which contribute in the width check.

        "metrics" can be one of the constants \Euclidian, \Square or \Projection. See there for a description of these constants.

        "ignore_angle" specifies the angle limit of two edges. If two edges form an angle equal or above the given value, they will not contribute in the check. Setting this value to 90 (the default) will exclude edges with an angle of 90 degree or more from the check.
        Use nil for this value to select the default.

        "min_projection" and "max_projection" allow selecting edges by their projected value upon each other. It is sufficient if the projection of one edge on the other matches the specified condition. The projected length must be larger or equal to "min_projection" and less than "max_projection". If you don't want to specify one limit, pass nil to the respective value.

        "shielded" controls whether shielding is applied. Shielding means that rule violations are not detected 'through' other features. Measurements are only made where the opposite edge is unobstructed.
        Shielding often is not optional as a rule violation in shielded case automatically comes with rule violations between the original and the shielding features. If not necessary, shielding can be disabled by setting this flag to false. In general, this will improve performance somewhat.

        "opposite_filter" specifies whether to require or reject errors happening on opposite sides of a figure. "rect_filter" allows suppressing specific error configurations on rectangular input figures.

        If "negative" is true, only edges from the first input are output as pseudo edge-pairs where the distance is larger or equal to the limit. This is a way to flag the parts of the first input where the distance to the second input is bigger. Note that only the first input's edges are output. The output is still edge pairs, but each edge pair contains one edge from the original input and the reverse version of the edge as the second edge.

        A net filter can be provided with the 'net_filter' argument. If given, only nets from this set are produced. Example:

        @code
        connect(metal1, via1)
        connect(via1, metal2)

        metal1_all_nets = metal1.nets

        If "whole_edges" is true, the resulting \EdgePairs collection will receive the whole edges which contribute in the width check.

        "metrics" can be one of the constants \Euclidian, \Square or \Projection. See there for a description of these constants.

        "ignore_angle" specifies the angle limit of two edges. If two edges form an angle equal or above the given value, they will not contribute in the check. Setting this value to 90 (the default) will exclude edges with an angle of 90 degree or more from the check.
        Use nil for this value to select the default.

        "min_projection" and "max_projection" allow selecting edges by their projected value upon each other. It is sufficient if the projection of one edge on the other matches the specified condition. The projected length must be larger or equal to "min_projection" and less than "max_projection". If you don't want to specify one limit, pass nil to the respective value.

        "shielded" controls whether shielding is applied. Shielding means that rule violations are not detected 'through' other features. Measurements are only made where the opposite edge is unobstructed.
        Shielding often is not optional as a rule violation in shielded case automatically comes with rule violations between the original and the shielding features. If not necessary, shielding can be disabled by setting this flag to false. In general, this will improve performance somewhat.

        "opposite_filter" specifies whether to require or reject errors happening on opposite sides of a figure. "rect_filter" allows suppressing specific error configurations on rectangular input figures.

        If "negative" is true, only edges from the first input are output as pseudo edge-pairs where the separation is larger or equal to the limit. This is a way to flag the parts of the first input where the distance to the second input is bigger. Note that only the first input's edges are output. The output is still edge pairs, but each edge pair contains one edge from the original input and the reverse version of the edge as the second edge.

        @param negative If true, edges not violation the condition will be output as pseudo-edge pairs
        @param property_constraint Only \IgnoreProperties and \NoPropertyConstraint are allowed - in the last case, properties are copied from the original shapes to the output. Other than 'width' allow more options here.

        This version is similar to the simple version with one parameter. In addition, it allows to specify many more options.

        If "whole_edges" is true, the resulting \EdgePairs collection will receive the whole edges which contribute in the width check.

        "metrics" can be one of the constants \Euclidian, \Square or \Projection. See there for a description of these constants.

        "ignore_angle" specifies the angle limit of two edges. If two edges form an angle equal or above the given value, they will not contribute in the check. Setting this value to 90 (the default) will exclude edges with an angle of 90 degree or more from the check.
        Use nil for this value to select the default.

        "min_projection" and "max_projection" allow selecting edges by their projected value upon each other. It is sufficient if the projection of one edge on the other matches the specified condition. The projected length must be larger or equal to "min_projection" and less than "max_projection". If you don't want to specify one limit, pass nil to the respective value.

        "shielded" controls whether shielding is applied. Shielding means that rule violations are not detected 'through' other features. Measurements are only made where the opposite edge is unobstructed.
        Shielding often is not optional as a rule violation in shielded case automatically comes with rule violations between the original and the shielding features. If not necessary, shielding can be disabled by setting this flag to false. In general, this will improve performance somewhat.

        Merged semantics applies for the input of this method (see \merged_semantics= for a description of this concept)

        The 'shielded' and 'negative' options have been introduced in version 0.27. 'property_constraint' has been added in version 0.28.4.

    Usually the default constructor provides a suitable object. Please note, that the format written is "GDS2" by default. Either explicitly set a format using \format= or derive the format from the file name using \set_format_from_filename.

    The layers are specified by either selecting all layers or by defining layer by layer using the
    \add_layer method. \select_all_layers will explicitly select all layers for saving, \deselect_all_layers will explicitly clear the list of layers.

    Cells are selected in a similar fashion: by default, all cells are selected. Using \add_cell, specific
    cells can be selected for saving. All these cells plus their hierarchy will then be written to the stream file.

class TextGenerator:
    r"""
    @brief A text generator class

    A text generator is basically a way to produce human-readable text for labelling layouts. It's similar to the Basic.TEXT PCell, but more convenient to use in a scripting context.

    Generators can be constructed from font files (or resources) or one of the registered generators can be used.

    To create a generator from a font file proceed this way:
    @code
    gen = RBA::TextGenerator::new
    gen.load_from_file("myfont.gds")
    region = gen.text("A TEXT", 0.001)
    @/code

    This code produces a RBA::Region with a database unit of 0.001 micron. This region can be fed into a \Shapes container to place it into a cell for example.

    By convention the font files must have two to three layers:

    @ul
    @li 1/0 for the actual data @/li
    @li 2/0 for the borders @/li
    @li 3/0 for an optional additional background @/li
    @/ul

    Currently, all glyphs must be bottom-left aligned at 0, 0. The
    border must be drawn in at least one glyph cell. The border is taken
    as the overall bbox of all borders.

    The glyph cells must be named with a single character or "nnn" where "d" is the
    ASCII code of the character (i.e. "032" for space). Allowed ASCII codes are 32 through 127.
    If a lower-case "a" character is defined, lower-case letters are supported.
    Otherwise, lowercase letters are mapped to uppercase letters.

    Undefined characters are left blank in the output.

    A comment cell can be defined ("COMMENT") which must hold one text in layer 1
    stating the comment, and additional descriptions such as line width:

    @ul
    @li "line_width=<x>": Specifies the intended line width in micron units @/li
    @li "design_grid=<x>": Specifies the intended design grid in micron units @/li
    @li any other text: The description string @/li
    @/ul

    Generators can be picked form a list of predefined generator. See \generators, \default_generator and \generator_by_name for picking a generator from the list.

class Texts(ShapeCollection):
    r"""
    @brief Texts (a collection of texts)

    Text objects are useful as labels for net names, to identify certain regions and to specify specific locations in general. Text collections provide a way to store - also in a hierarchical fashion - and manipulate a collection of text objects.

    Text objects can be turned into polygons by creating small boxes around the texts (\polygons). Texts can also be turned into dot-like edges (\edges). Texts can be filtered by string, either by matching against a fixed string (\with_text) or a glob-style pattern (\with_match).

    Text collections can be filtered geometrically against a polygon \Region using \interacting or \non-interacting. Vice versa, texts can be used to select polygons from a \Region using \pull_interacting.

    Beside that, text collections can be transformed, flattened and combined, similar to \EdgePairs.

    This class has been introduced in version 0.27.

class TilingProcessor:
    r"""
    @brief A processor for layout which distributes tasks over tiles

    The tiling processor executes one or several scripts on one or multiple layouts providing a tiling scheme. In that scheme, the processor divides the original layout into rectangular tiles and executes the scripts on each tile separately. The tiling processor allows one to specify multiple, independent scripts which are run separately on each tile. It can make use of multi-core CPU's by supporting multiple threads running the tasks in parallel (with respect to tiles and scripts).

    Tiling a optional - if no tiles are specified, the tiling processing basically operates flat and parallelization extends to the scripts only.

    Tiles can be overlapping to gather input from neighboring tiles into the current tile. In order to provide that feature, a border can be specified which gives the amount by which the search region is extended beyond the border of the tile. To specify the border, use the \TilingProcessor#tile_border method.

    The basis of the tiling processor are \Region objects and expressions. Expressions are a built-in simple language to form simple scripts. Expressions allow access to the objects and methods built into KLayout. Each script can consist of multiple operations. Scripts are specified using \TilingProcessor#queue.

    Input is provided to the script through variables holding a \Region object each. From outside the tiling processor, input is specified with the \TilingProcessor#input method. This method is given a name and a \RecursiveShapeIterator object which delivers the data for the input. On the script side, a \Region object is provided through a variable named like the first argument of the "input" method.

    Inside the script the following functions are provided:

    @ul
    @li"_dbu" delivers the database unit used for the computations @/li
    @li"_tile" delivers a region containing a mask for the tile (a rectangle) or nil if no tiling is used @/li
    @li"_output" is used to deliver output (see below) @/li
    @/ul

    Output can be obtained from the tiling processor by registering a receiver with a channel. A channel is basically a name. Inside the script, the name describes a variable which can be used as the first argument of the "_output" function to identify the channel. A channel is registers using the \TilingProcessor#output method. Beside the name, a receiver must be specified. A receiver is either another layout (a cell of that), a report database or a custom receiver implemented through the \TileOutputReceiver class.

    The "_output" function expects two or three parameters: one channel id (the variable that was defined by the name given in the output method call) and an object to output (a \Region, \Edges, \EdgePairs or a geometrical primitive such as \Polygon or \Box). In addition, a boolean argument can be given indicating whether clipping at the tile shall be applied. If clipping is requested (the default), the shapes will be clipped at the tile's box.

    The tiling can be specified either through a tile size, a tile number or both. If a tile size is specified with the \TilingProcessor#tile_size method, the tiling processor will compute the number of tiles required. If the tile count is given (through \TilingProcessor#tiles), the tile size will be computed. If both are given, the tiling array is fixed and the array is centered around the original layout's center. If the tiling origin is given as well, the tiling processor will use the given array without any modifications.

    Once the tiling processor has been set up, the operation can be launched using \TilingProcessor#execute.

    This is some sample code. It performs two XOR operations between two layouts and delivers the results to a report database:

    @code
    ly1 = ... # first layout
    ly2 = ... # second layout

    rdb = RBA::ReportDatabase::new("xor")
    output_cell = rdb.create_cell(ly1.top_cell.name)
    output_cat1 = rbd.create_category("XOR 1-10")
    output_cat2 = rbd.create_category("XOR 2-11")

    tp = RBA::TilingProcessor::new
    tp.input("a1", ly1, ly1.top_cell.cell_index, RBA::LayerInfo::new(1, 0))
    tp.input("a2", ly1, ly1.top_cell.cell_index, RBA::LayerInfo::new(2, 0))

    Simple transformations only provide rotations about angles which a multiples of 90 degree.
    Together with the mirror options, this results in 8 distinct orientations (fixpoint transformations).
    These can be combined with a displacement which is applied after the rotation/mirror.
    This version acts on integer coordinates. A version for floating-point coordinates is \DTrans.

    Here are some examples for using the Trans class:

    @code
    t = RBA::Trans::new(0, 100)  # displacement by 100 DBU in y direction
    # the inverse: -> "r0 0,-100"
    t.inverted.to_s
    # concatenation: -> "r90 -100,0"
    (RBA::Trans::R90 * t).to_s
    # apply to a point: -> "0,100"
    RBA::Trans::R90.trans(RBA::Point::new(100, 0))

    @brief A complex transformation

    A complex transformation provides magnification, mirroring at the x-axis, rotation by an arbitrary
    angle and a displacement. This is also the order, the operations are applied.
    This version can transform floating point coordinate objects into integer coordinate objects, which may involve rounding and can be inexact.

    Complex transformations are extensions of the simple transformation classes (\Trans in that case) and behave similar.

    Transformations can be used to transform points or other objects. Transformations can be combined with the '*' operator to form the transformation which is equivalent to applying the second and then the first. Here is some code:

    @code
    # Create a transformation that applies a magnification of 1.5, a rotation by 90 degree
    # and displacement of 10 in x and 20 units in y direction:
    t = RBA::VCplxTrans::new(1.5, 90, false, 10, 20)
    t.to_s            # r90 *1.5 10,20
    # compute the inverse:
    t.inverted.to_s   # r270 *0.666666667 -13,7
    # Combine with another displacement (applied after that):
    (RBA::VCplxTrans::new(5, 5) * t).to_s     # r90 *1.5 15,25
    # Transform a point:
    t.trans(RBA::DPoint::new(100, 200)).to_s  # -290,170
    @/code

    The VCplxTrans type is the inverse transformation of the CplxTrans transformation and vice versa.Transformations of VCplxTrans type can be concatenated (operator *) with either itself or with transformations of compatible input or output type. This means, the operator VCplxTrans * CplxTrans is allowed (output types of CplxTrans and input of VCplxTrans are identical) while VCplxTrans * ICplxTrans is not.

    This class has been introduced in version 0.25.

        Calling this method will make this object no longer owned by the script's memory management. Instead, the object must be managed in some other way.

After the script engine decides to delete the reference, the object itself will still exist. If the object is not managed otherwise, memory leaks will occur.
