  <p>
  To delete a whole cell, select the cell in the hierarchy browser and choose "Delete Cell" from the 
  context menu (right mouse button). This time, three possible modes are offered:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Shallow delete:</b> Just the cell (its shapes and instances) are deleted, not
      any cells referenced by this cell. Since cells might no longer be referenced after
      that, they may appear as new top cells in the layout.</li>
    <li><b>Deep delete:</b> The cell and all its subcells are deleted, unless the subcells are
      referenced otherwise (by cells that are not deleted).
      In this delete mode a complete hierarchy of cells can be removed without side effects.</li>
    <li><b>Complete delete:</b> The cell and all its subcells are deleted, even if other cells
      would reference these subcells.</li>
  </ul>
