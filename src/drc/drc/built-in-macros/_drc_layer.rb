    # This method can be applied to original layers - i.e. ones that have
    # been created with \input. By default, a small box (2x2 DBU) will be produced on each
    # selected text. By using the "as_dots" option, degenerated point-like edges will be
    # produced.
    #
    # The preferred method however is to use true text layers created with \labels.
    # In this case, without specifying "as_dots" or "as_boxes" retains the text
    # objects as such a text filtering is applied. In contrast to this, layers generated
    # with \input cannot maintain the text nature of the selected objects and 
    # produce dots or small polygon boxes in the \texts method.
    #
    # Texts can be selected either by exact match string or a pattern match with a 
    # glob-style pattern. By default, glob-style pattern are used. 
    # The options available are:
    #
    # @ul
    #   @li @b pattern(p) @/b: Use a pattern to match the string (this is the default) @/li  
    #   @li @b text(s) @/b: Select the texts that exactly match the given string @/li  
    #   @li @b as_boxes @/b: with this option, small boxes will be produced as markers @/li  
    #   @li @b as_dots @/b: with this option, point-like edges will be produced instead of small boxes @/li  
    # @/ul
    #
    # Here are some examples:
    #
    # @code
    #   # Selects all texts
    #   t = labels(1, 0).texts
    #   # Selects all texts beginning with an "A"

    #     ":center" or ":left" to indicate which part will be produced. @/li
    #   @li @b With two floating-point arguments @/b: These arguments specify
    #     a point relative to the bounding box. The first argument is a relative
    #     x coordinate where 0.0 means "left side of the bounding box" and 1.0
    #     is the right side. The second argument is a relative y coordinate where
    #     0.0 means "bottom" and 1.0 means "top". The results will be small 
    #     (2x2 DBU) boxes or point-like edges for edge output @/li
    #   @li @b With four floating-point arguments @/b: These arguments specify
    #     a box in relative coordinates: a pair of x/y relative coordinate for
    #     the first point and another pair for the second point. The results will
    #     be boxes or a tilted edge in case of edge output. If the range specifies
    #     a finite-area box (height and width are not zero), no adjustment of 
    #     the boxes will happen for polygon output - i.e. the additional enlargement 
    #     by 1 DBU which is applied for zero-area boxes does not happen.@/li
    # @/ul
    # 
    # The formal specifiers are for points:
    # 
    # @ul
    #   @li @b :center @/b or @b :c @/b: the center point @/li
    #   @li @b :bottom_center @/b or @b :bc @/b: the bottom center point @/li
    #   @li @b :bottom_left @/b or @b :bl @/b: the bottom left point @/li

    #   @li @b :right @/b or @b :r @/b: the right point @/li
    #   @li @b :top_center @/b or @b :tc @/b: the top center point @/li
    #   @li @b :top_left @/b or @b :tl @/b: the top left point @/li
    #   @li @b :top_right @/b or @b :tr @/b: the top right point @/li
    # @/ul
    #
    # The formal specifiers for lines are:
    # 
    # @ul
    #   @li @b :bottom @/b or @b :b @/b: the bottom line @/li
    #   @li @b :top @/b or @b :t @/b: the top line @/li
    #   @li @b :left @/b or @b :l @/b: the left line @/li
    #   @li @b :right @/b or @b :r @/b: the right line @/li
    # @/ul
    #
    # Dots are represented by small (2x2 DBU) boxes or point-like
    # edges with edge output. Lines are represented by narrow or 
    # flat (2 DBU) boxes or edges for edge output. Edges will follow
    # the orientation convention for the corresponding edges - i.e.
    # "inside" of the bounding box is on the right side of the edge.
    #
    # The following additional option controls the output format:
    #
    # @ul
    #   @li @b as_boxes @/b: with this option, small boxes will be produced as markers @/li  
    #   @li @b as_dots @/b or @b as_edges @/b: with this option, point-like edges will be produced for dots

    # for polygon layers, RBA::DPolygon objects need to be returned. For edge layers those need to be RBA::DEdge
    # and for edge pair layers, they need to be RBA::DEdgePair objects. For convenience, RBA::Polygon, RBA::Edge

    # A width check can be performed on polygon and edge layers. On edge layers, all
    # edges are checked against all other edges. If two edges form a "back to back" relation
    # (i.e. their inner sides face each other) and their distance is less than the specified
    # value, an error shape is generated for that edge pair. 
    # On polygon layers, the polygons on each layer are checked for locations where their
    # width is less than the specified value. In that case, an edge pair error shape is generated.
    # 
    # The options available are:
    #
    # @ul
    #   @li @b euclidian @/b: perform the check using Euclidian metrics (this is the default) @/li  
    #   @li @b square @/b: perform the check using Square metrics @/li  
    #   @li @b projection @/b: perform the check using projection metrics @/li
    #   @li @b whole_edges @/b: With this option, the check will return all of the edges,
    #         even if the criterion is violated only over a part of the edge @/li
    #   @li @b angle_limit(a) @/b: Specifies the angle above or equal to which no 
    #         check is performed. The default value is 90, which means that for edges having 
    #         an angle of 90 degree or more, no check is performed. Setting this value to 45 will
    #         make the check only consider edges enclosing angles of less than 45 degree. @/li
    #   @li @b projection_limits(min, max) or projection_limits(min .. max) @/b:
    #         this option makes the check only consider edge pairs whose projected length on
    #         each other is more or equal than min and less than max @/li
    # @/ul
    #
    # Note that without the angle_limit, acute corners will always be reported, since two 
    # connected edges always violate the width in the corner. By adjusting the angle_limit, an 
    # acute corner check can be implemented.
    #
    # Merge semantics applies to this method, i.e. disconnected polygons are merged before the 
    # width is checked unless "raw" mode is chosen.
    # 
    # The resulting edge pairs can be converted to polygons using the \polygons method.
    # 
    # Distance values can be given as floating-point values (in micron) or integer values (in

    #   # width check for 1.5 micron:
    #   markers = in.width(1.5)
    #   # width check for 2 database units:

    #   # width check for 2 micron:

    # A space check can be performed on polygon and edge layers. On edge layers, all
    # edges are checked against all other edges. If two edges form a "face to face" relation
    # (i.e. their outer sides face each other) and their distance is less than the specified
    # value, an error shape is generated for that edge pair. 
    # On polygon layers, the polygons on each layer are checked for space against other polygons 
    # for locations where their space is less than the specified value. In that case, an edge 
    # pair error shape is generated.
    # The space check will also check the polygons for space violations against themselves, i.e.
    # notches violating the space condition are reported.
    #
    # The \notch method is similar, but will only report self-space violations. The \isolated
    # method will only report space violations to other polygons. \separation is a two-layer
