/**
 *  @brief A helper object that is attached to a QObject to monitor it's lifetime
 *
 *  This object will be put into the properties table of the QObject (more precisely: a copy).
 *  When the QObject is destroyed, it's properties are destroyed too and through reference
 *  counting the destruction of the QObject is detected. The monitoring itself is implemented
 *  through a gsi::ObjectBase object which plugs seamlessly into the gsi type system:
 *
 *     QObject -> QtWatcher (+ temp copies) -> gsi::ObjectBase -> plugs into script objects
 *
 *  NOTE: the initial idea was to use child objects attached to QObject. However, these
 *  interfere too much with Qt's internals - for example, attaching a child object emits
 *  a QChildEvent. That gets filtered in some eventFilter function which itself may cause
 *  QObjects to be decorated with helper objects ... resulting in a infinte recursion.
 *
 *  Decoration by properties is a leaner solution.
