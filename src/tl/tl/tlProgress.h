 *  an absolute value. 
 *  This implementation delegates the actual implementation
 *  to an "adaptor" class that handles the actual display
 *  of the progress.
 *
 *  This class also allows for some kind of background processing:
 *  once the test() method is called, the 
 *  adaptor's yield() method is called once that "yield_interval" 
 *  calls have passed. The yield_interval value should be chosen
 *  sufficiently large so that no performance penalty is to be paid
 *  for this. In addition, each test() call tests whether
 *  the operation may have been cancelled and may throw an 
 *  BreakException in this case.
 *
 *  This class is basically a base class for the actual implementation.
 *  A functionality every progress object must provide is the 
 *  ability to deliver a relative value and a textual description of 
 *  the progress. By default the progress is displayed as a bar 
 *  showing the relative progress.
