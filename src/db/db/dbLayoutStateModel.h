/**
 *  @brief The layout state model
 *
 *  The layout state model is supposed to track the state of a layout object.
 *  The layout object to be tracked should be derived from db::LayoutStateModel
 *  and implement the do_update method. 
 *  The state model can track the state of any layout (or similar) object in two
 *  ways: once, if the bounding boxes become invalid and in another way, if the
 *  cell tree becomes invalid. These events are issued by containers used within
 *  the layout object (i.e. db::Shapes) and "collected" in the layout state model.
 *  Calling "update" will reset this state and call "do_update" to bring the 
 *  layout object into a consistent state.
 *  In addition, observers using the tl::Observer interface can attach to this
 *  state model to track if the layout changes it's state.
