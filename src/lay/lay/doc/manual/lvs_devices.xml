  <h2>Device extractors and device classes</h2>

  <p>
  KLayout provides two concepts for handling device variety: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <b>Device classes</b> are device categories. There are general categories such as
  resistors or MOS transistors. Specific categories can be created to represent specific
  incarnations - e.g. NMOS and PMOS devices. Device classes also determine how devices
  combine.
  </p>

  <p>Device classes are documented here: <link href="/manual/lvs_device_classes.xml"/>.</p>

  <p>
  <b>Device extractors</b> are the actual worker objects that analyze layout and produce devices. 
  As for device classes, there are general device extractors. Each device extractor produces
  devices from a specific class.
  </p>

  <p>Device extractors are documented here: <link href="/manual/lvs_device_extractors.xml"/>.</p>
