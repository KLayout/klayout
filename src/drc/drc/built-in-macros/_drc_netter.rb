  # @brief DRC Reference: Netter object
  # The Netter object provides services related to network extraction
  # from a layout. The relevant methods of this object are available
  # as global functions too where they act on a default incarnation
  # of the netter. Usually it's not required to instantiate a Netter
  # object, but it serves as a container for this functionality.
  #
  # @code
  # # create a new Netter object:
  # nx = netter
  # nx.connect(poly, contact)
  # ...
  # @/code
  #
  # Network formation:
  # 
  # A basic service the Netter object provides is the formation of 
  # connected networks of conductive shapes (netting). To do so, the Netter
  # must be given a connection specification. This happens by calling
  # "connect" with two polygon layers. The Netter will then regard all
  # overlaps of shapes on these layers as connections between the
  # respective materials. Networks are the basis for netlist extraction,
  # network geometry deduction and the antenna check.
  #
  # Connections can be cleared with "clear_connections". If not, 
  # connections add atop of the already defined ones. Here is an 
  # example for the antenna check:
  # 
  # @code
  # # build connction of poly+gate to metal1
  # connect(gate, poly)
  # connect(poly, contact)
  # connect(contact, metal1)
  #
  # # runs an antenna check for metal1 with a ratio of 50
  # m1_antenna_errors = antenna_check(gate, metal1, 50.0)
  #  
  # # add connections to metal2
  # connect(metal1, via1)
  # connect(via1, metal2)
  #
  # # runs an antenna check for metal2 with a ratio of 70.0
  # m2_antenna_errors = antenna_check(gate, metal2, 70.0)
  # 
  # # this will remove all connections made
  # clear_connections
  # ...
  # @/code
  #
  # Further functionality of the Netter object:
  #
  # More methods will be added in the future to support network-related features.

    # to form an electrical connection between the materials formed by
    # these layers. This also implies intra-layer connections: shapes
    # on these layers touching or overlapping other shapes on these
    # layers will form bigger, electrically connected areas.
    #
    # Texts will be used to assign net names to the nets. The preferred
    # method is to use \labels to create a text layer from a design 
    # layer. When using \input, text labels are carried implicitly
    # with the polygons but at the cost of small dummy shapes (2x2 DBU
    # marker polygons) and limited functionality.

    # 
    # The device extractor is either an instance of one of the predefined extractor

    # It provides the

    # Predefined device extractors are:

    # @ul
    # @li \global#mos3 - A three-terminal MOS transistor @/li
    # @li \global#mos4 - A four-terminal MOS transistor @/li

    # of device extractor. The device extractor beside the algorithm and specific

    # @brief Performs an antenna check
    # @name antenna_check
    # @synopsis antenna_check(gate, metal, ratio, [ diode_specs ... ])
    #
    # The antenna check is used to avoid plasma induced damage. Physically, 
    # the damage happes if during the manufacturing of a metal layer with
    # plasma etching charge accumulates on the metal islands. On reaching a
    # certain threshold, this charge may discarge over gate oxide attached of 
    # devices attached to such metal areas hence damaging it.
    #
    # Antenna checks are performed by collecting all connected nets up to
    # a certain metal layer and then computing the area of all metal shapes
    # and all connected gates of a certain kind (e.g. thin and thick oxide gates).
    # The ratio of metal area divided by the gate area must not exceed a certain
    # threshold.
    #
    # A simple antenna check is this:
    #
    # @code
    # poly = ... # poly layer
    # diff = ... # diffusion layer
    # contact = ... # contact layer
    # metal1 = ... # metal layer
    # 
    # # compute gate area
    # gate = poly & diff
    #
    # # note that gate and poly have to be included - gate is
    # # a subset of poly, but forms the sensitive area
    # connect(gate, poly)
    # connect(poly, contact)
    # connect(contact, metal1)
    # errors = antenna_check(gate, metal1, 50.0)
    # @/code
    #
    # Plasma induced damage can be rectified by including diodes
    # which create a safe current path for discharging the metal
    # islands. Such diodes can be identified with a recognition layer
    # (usually the diffusion area of a certain kind). You can include
    # such diode recognition layers in the antenna check. If a connection
    # is detected to a diode, the respective network is skipped:
    #
    # @code
    # ...
    # diode = ... # diode recognition layer
    #
    # connect(diode, contact)
    # errors = antenna_check(gate, metal1, 50.0, diode)
    # @/code
    #
    # You can also make diode connections decreases the
    # sensitivity of the antenna check depending on the size
    # of the diode. The following specification makes 
    # diode connections increase the ratio threshold by
    # 10 per square micrometer of diode area:
    #
    # @code
    # ...
    # diode = ... # diode recognition layer
    #
    # connect(diode, contact)
    # # each square micrometer of diode area connected to a network
    # # will add 10 to the ratio:
    # errors = antenna_check(gate, metal1, 50.0, [ diode, 10.0 ])
    # @/code
    #
    # Multiple diode specifications are allowed. Just add them 
    # to the antenna_check call.
    #
    # You can include the perimeter into the area computation for
    # the gate or metal layer or both. The physical picture
    # is this: the side walls of the material contribute to the 
    # surface too. As the side wall area can be estimated by taking
    # the perimeter times some material thickness, the effective 
    # area is: 
    #
    # @code
    # A(eff) = A + P * t
    # @/code
    #
    # Here A is the area of the polygons and P is their perimeter.
    # t is the "thickness" in micrometer units. To specify such
    # a condition, use the following notation:
    #
    # @code
    # errors = antenna_check(area_and_perimeter(gate, 0.5), ...)
    # @/code
    #
    # "area_and_perimeter" takes the polygon layer and the 
    # thickness (0.5 micrometers in this case). 
    # This notation can be applied to both gate and
    # metal layers. A detailed notation for the usual,
    # area-only case is available as well for completeness:
    #
    # @code
    # errors = antenna_check(area_only(gate), ...)
    # 
    # # this is equivalent to a zero thickness:
    # errors = antenna_check(area_and_perimeter(gate, 0.0), ...)
    # # or the standard case:
    # errors = antenna_check(gate, ...)
    # @/code
    #
    # Finally there is also "perimeter_only". When using this 
    # specification with a thickness value, the area is computed
    # from the perimeter alone:
    #
    # @code
    # A(eff) = P * t
    # @/code
    #
    # @code
    # errors = antenna_check(perimeter_only(gate, 0.5), ...)
    # @/code
    #
    # The error shapes produced by the antenna check are copies
    # of the metal shapes on the metal layers of each network 
    # violating the antenna rule.
