/**
 *  @brief The Netlist Extractor
 *
 *  This is the main object responsible for extracting nets from a layout.
 *
 *  The layout needs to be present as a DeepShapeStore shadow layout. Use hierarchical regions
 *  (db::Region build with a DeepShapeStore) to populate the shape store.
 *
 *  The extraction requires a connectivity definition through db::Connectivity.
 *
 *  In addition, the device extraction needs to happen before net extraction.
 *  Device extraction will pre-fill the netlist with circuits and devices and
 *  annotate the layout with terminal shapes, so the net extraction can connect
 *  to the device terminals.
 *
 *  If the deep shape store has been configured to supply text label annotated
 *  markers (DeepShapeStore::set_text_property_name and DeepShapeStore::set_text_enlargement
 *  to at least 1), texts from layers included in the connectivity will be extracted
 *  as net names. If multiple texts are present, the names will be concatenated using
 *  comma separators.
 *
 *  Upon extraction, the given netlist is filled with circuits (unless present already),
 *  subcircuits, pins and of course nets. This object also supplies access to the net's
 *  geometries through the clusters() method. This method delivers a hierarchical
 *  cluster object. The nets refer to specific clusters through their "cluster_id"
 *  attribute.
