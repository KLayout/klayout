    # @brief Provides a generic DRC function for use with \DRC# expressions
    # @synopsis layer.drc(expression)
    #
    # This method implements the universal DRC which offers enhanced abilities,
    # improved performance in some applications and better readability.
    #
    # The key concept for this method are DRC expressions. DRC expressions
    # are formed by using predefined keywords like "width", operators like "&" 
    # and methods to build an abstract definition of the operations to perform
    # within the DRC.
    #
    # When the DRC function is executed, it will basically visit all shapes
    # from the input layer (the layer, the "drc" method is called on)).
    # While it does, it collects the neighbor shapes from all involved other inputs 
    # and runs the requested operations on each cluster. 
    # Currently, "drc" is only available for polygon layers.
    #
    # This way, the nature of the "drc" operation is that of the loop over all (merged) input
    # polygons. Within the operation executed on each shape, it's possible to make
    # decisions such as "if the shape has an area larger than something, apply this
    # operation" or similar. This often can be achieved with conventional DRC functions too,
    # but involves potentially complex and heavy operations such as booleans, interact
    # etc. For this reason, the "drc" function may provide a better performance.
    #
    # In addition, within the loop a single shape from the input layer is presented to the
    # execution engine which runs the operations.
    # This allows using operations such as "size" without having to consider 
    # neighbor polygons growing into the area of the initial shape. In this sense,
    # the "drc" function sees the layer as individual polygons rather than
    # a global "sea of polygons". This enables new applications which are otherwise
    # difficult to implement.
    #
    # @h3 Primaries and secondaries @/h3
    #
    # An important concept in "drc" expressions is the "primary".
    # The primary represents a single shape from the input layer. "Secondaries" are shapes
    # from other inputs. Primaries guide the operation - secondaries without
    # primaries are not seen. The "drc" operation will look for secondaries within
    # a certain distance which is determined from the operations from the 
    # expression to execute. The secondaries collected in this step will not be
    # merged, so the secondary polygons may be partial. This is important when
    # using measurement operations like "area" on secondary polygons.
    #
    # @h3 Checks @/h3
    #
    # Here is an example for a generic DRC operation which performs a width
    # check for less than 0.5.um on the primary shapes. It uses the "\global#width" operator:
    #
    # @code
    # out = in.drc(width < 0.5.um)
    # @/code
    #
    # Other single or double-bounded conditions are available too, for example:
    #
    # @code
    # out = in.drc(width <= 0.5.um)
    # out = in.drc(width > 0.5.um)
    # out = in.drc(width == 0.5.um)
    # out = in.drc(width != 0.5.um)
    # out = in.drc(0.2.um < width < 0.5.um)
    # @/code
    #
    # To specify the second input for a two-layer check, add it to 
    # the check function. This example shows how to use a two-layer separation check ("\global#separation"):
    #
    # @code
    # l1 = input(1, 0)
    # l2 = input(2, 0)
    # out = l1.drc(separation(l2) < 0.5.um)
    # @/code
    #
    # The second input of this check function can be a computed expression. In this
    # case the local loop will first evaluate the expression for the second input and
    # then use the result as second input in the check. Note that this computation is
    # performed locally and separately for each primary and its context.
    #
    # Options for the checks are also specified inside the brackets. For example,
    # to select projection metrics ("projection") for the "width" check use:
    #
    # @code 
    # out = in.drc(width(projection) < 0.5.um)
    # @/code
    #
    #
    # @h3 Edges and edge pairs @/h3
    #
    # Although the "drc" function operates on polygon layers, internally it is 
    # able to handle edge and edge pair types too. Some operations generate edge pairs,
    # some other generate edges. As results from one operation can be processed further
    # in the DRC expressions, methods are available to filter, process and convert
    # these types.
    #
    # For example, all checks produce edge pairs which can be converted into polygons
    # using the "polygons" method:
    #
    # @code
    # out = in.drc((width(projection) < 0.5.um).polygons)
    # @/code
    # 
    # Note a subtle detail: when putting the "polygons" method inside the "drc"
    # brackets, it is executed locally on every visited primary polygon. The result
    # in this case is identical to the global conversion:
    #
    # @code
    # # same, but with "global" conversion:
    # out = in.drc(width(projection) < 0.5.um).polygons
    # @/code
    #
    # But having the check polygons inside the loop opens new opportunities and 
    # is more efficient in general. In the previous example, the local conversion
    # will keep a few edge pairs after having converted them to polygons. In
    # the global case, all edge pairs are collected first and then converted.
    # If there are many edge pairs, this requires more memory and a larger computing
    # overhead for managing the bigger number of shapes.
    #
    # For the conversion of edges, edge pairs and polygons into other types, these
    # methods are provided:
    #
    # @ul
    # @li "\DRC#polygons": converts edge pairs to polygons @/li
    # @li "\DRC#extended", "\DRC#extended_in", "\DRC#extended_out": converts edges to polygons @/li
    # @li "\DRC#first_edges", \DRC#second_edges": extracts edges from edge pairs @/li
    # @li "\DRC#edges": decomposes edge pairs and polygons into edges @/li
    # @li "\DRC#corners": can extract corners from polygons @/li
    # @/ul
    #
    # The following example decomposes the primary polygons into edges:
    # 
    # @code
    # out = in.drc(primary.edges)
    # @/code
    #
    # (for backward compatibility you cannot abbreviate "primary.edges" simply as "edges" like
    # other functions). 
    #
    # The previous example isn't quite exciting as it is equivalent to 
    #
    # @code
    # # Same as above
    # out = in.edges
    # @/code
    #
    # But it gets more interesting, as within the loop, "edges" delivers the edge set for
    # each individual polygon. It's possible to work with this distinct set, so for example
    # this will give you the edges of polygons with more than four corners:
    #
    # @code
    # out = in.drc(primary.edges.count > 4)
    # @/code
    #
    # Explanation: "count" is a "quantifier" which takes any kind of set (edges, edge pairs, polygons)
    # and returns the set if the number of inhabitants meets the given condition. Otherwise the set
    # is skipped. So it will look at the edges and if there are more than four (per primary shape),
    # it will forward this set. 
    # 
    # The same result can be achieved with classic DRC with "interact" and a figure count, but
    # at a much higher computation cost.
    #
    # @h3 Edge and edge/polygon operations @/h3
    #
    # The "drc" framework supports the following edge and edge/polygon operations:
    #
    # @ul
    # @li Edge vs. edge and edge vs. polygon booleans @/li
    # @li Edge vs. polygon interactions ("\DRC#interacting", "\DRC#overlapping") @/li
    # @li Edge sampling ("\DRC#start_segments", "\DRC#centers", "\DRC#end_segments") @/li
    # @/ul
    #
    # @h3 Filters @/h3
    #
    # Filter operators select input polygons or edges based on their properties. These filters are provided:
    #
    # @ul
    # @li "\DRC#area": selects polygons based on their area @/li
    # @li "\DRC#perimeter": selects polygons based on their perimeter @/li
    # @li "\DRC#area_ratio": selects polygons based on their bounding box to polygon area ratio @/li
    # @li "\DRC#bbox_aspect_ratio": selects polygons based on their bounding box aspect ratio @/li
    # @li "\DRC#relative_height": selects polygons based on their relative height @/li
    # @li "\DRC#bbox_min", "\global#bbox_max", "\global#bbox_width", "\global#bbox_height": selects polygons based on their bounding box properties @/li
    # @li "\DRC#length": selects edges based on their length @/li
    # @li "\DRC#angle": selects edges based on their orientation @/li
    # @/ul
    # 
    # For example, to select polygons with an area larger than one square micrometer, use:
    #
    # @code
    # out = in.drc(area > 1.0)
    # @/code
    #
    # For the condition, use the usual numerical bounds like:
    #
    # @code
    # out = in.drc(area == 1.0)
    # out = in.drc(area <= 1.0)
    # out = in.drc(0.2 < area < 1.0)
    # @/code
    #
    # The result of the area operation is the input polygon if the area condition is met.
    # 
    # In the same fashion, "perimeter" applies to the perimeter of the polygon.
    # "bbox_min" etc. will evaluate a particular dimensions of the polygon's bounding box and
    # use the respective dimension for filtering the polygon.
    #
    # Note that it's basically possible to use the polygon filters on any input - computed and secondaries.
    # In fact, plain "area" for example is a shortcut for "\global#primary.area" indicating that
    # the area of primary shapes are supposed to be computed.
    # However, any input other than the primary is not necessarily complete or it may 
    # consist of multiple polygons. Hence the computed values may be too big or too small.
    # It's recommended therefore to use the measurement functions on primary polygons
    # unless you know what you're doing.
    #
    # @h3 Filter predicates @/h3
    #
    # The "drc" feature also supports some predicates. "predicates" are boolean values
    # indicating a certain condition. A predicate filter works in a way that it only
    # passes the polygons if the condition is met.
    #
    # The predicates available currently are:
    #
    # @ul
    # @li "\global#rectangles": Filters rectangles @/li
    # @li "\global#squares": Filters squares @/li
    # @li "\global#rectilinear": Filters rectilinear ("Manhattan") polygons @/li
    # @/ul
    #
    # For the same reason as explained above, it's recommended to use these predicates
    # standalone, so they act on primary shapes. It's possible to use the predicates
    # on computed shapes or secondaries, but that may not render the desired results.
    #
    # @h3 Logical NOT operator @/h3
    #
    # The "!" operator will evaluate the expression behind it and return the 
    # current primary shape if the input is empty and return an empty polygon set 
    # if not. Hence the following filter will deliver all polygons which are 
    # not rectangles:
    #
    # @code
    # out = in.drc(! rectangles)
    # @/code
    #
    # @h3 Logical combination operators @/h3
    #
    # The logical "if_any" or "if_all" functions allow connecting multiple
    # conditions and evaluate to "true" (means: a non-empty shape set) if either
    # one input is a non-empty shape set ("if_any") or if all inputs are non-empty
    # ("if_all"). 
    #
    # For example, this will select all polygons which are rectangles
    # and whose area is larger than 20 square micrometers:
    #
    # @code
    # out = in.drc(if_all(rectangles, area > 20.0))
    # @/code
    #
    # "if_all" delivers the primary shape if all of the input expressions
    # render a non-empty result.
    #
    # In contrast to this, the "if_any" operation will deliver the primary shape
    # if one of the input expressions renders a non-empty result.
    #
    # The "\global#switch" function allows selecting one input based on the results of an
    # expression. In the two-input form it's equivalent to "if". The first expression
    # is the condition. If it evaluates to a non-empty shape set, the result of the
    # second expression is taken. Otherwise, the result is empty. 
    #
    # Hence the following code delivers all rectangles sized by 100 nm. All
    # other shapes are skipped:
    #
    # @code
    # out = in.drc(switch(rectangles, primary.sized(100.nm)))
    # @/code
    #
    # A third expression will be considered the "else" branch: the result of
    # this expression will be taken if the first one is not taken. So this
    # example will size all rectangles and leave other shapes untouched:
    #
    # @code
    # out = in.drc(switch(rectangles, primary.sized(100.nm), primary))
    # @/code
    #
    # If more expressions are given, they are considered as a sequence of condition/result
    # chain (c1, e1, c2, e2, ...) in the sense of "if(c1) return(e1) else if(c2) return(e2) ...".
    # So the e1 is taken if c1 is met, e2 is taken when c1 is not met, but c2 is and so forth.
    # If there is an odd number of expressions, the last one will be the default expression
    # which is taken if none of the conditions is met.
    #
    # @h3 Polygon manipulations @/h3
    #
    # The "drc" operations feature polygon manipulations where the input is
    # either the primary, secondaries or derived shapes.
    # Manipulations include sizing ("\global#sized"), corner rounding ("\global#rounded_corners"), smoothing ("\global#smoothed")
    # and boolean operations.
    #
    # This example computes a boolean AND between two layers before selecting
    # the result polygons with an area larger than 1 square micrometer. Note that
    # "primary" is a placeholder for the primary shape:
    #
    # @code
    # l1 = input(1, 0)
    # l2 = input(2, 0)
    # out = l1.drc((primary & l2).area > 1.0)
    # @/code
    #
    # This example demonstrates how the "drc" operation can improve performance: as the
    # boolean operation is computed locally and the result is discarded when no longer required,
    # less shapes need to be stored hence reducing the memory overhead and CPU time required
    # to manage these shapes.
    #
    # Note that the precise form of the example above is
    #
    # @code
    # out = l1.drc((primary & secondary(l2)).area > 1.0)
    # @/code
    #
    # The "\global#secondary" operator indicates that "l2" is to be used as secondary input to the "drc" function. Only
    # in this form, the operators of the boolean AND can be reversed:
    # 
    # @code
    # out = l1.drc((secondary(l2) & primary).area > 1.0)
    # @/code
    #
    # @h3 Quantifiers @/h3
    #
    # Some filters operate on properties of the full, local, per-primary shape set. 
    # While the loop is executed, the DRC expressions will collect shapes, either
    # from the primary, it's neighborhood (secondaries) or from deriving shape sets.
    #
    # Obviously the primary is a simple one: it consists of a single shape, because
    # this is how the loop operates. Derived shape sets however can be more complex.
    # "Quantifiers" allow assessing properties of the complete, per-primary shape
    # set. A simple one is "\DRC#count" which checks if the number of shapes within
    # a shape set is within a given range.
    #
    # Obviously, "primary.count == 1" is always true. So using "count" primaries isn't
    # much fun. So it's better to use it on derived sets.
    # The following condition will select all primary shapes which have more than 13 corners:
    #
    # @code
    # out = in.drc(if_any(primary.corners.count > 13))
    # @/code
    #
    # Note an important detail here: the "if_any" function will make this statement render primary
    # polygons, if the expression inside gives a non-empty result. Without
    # "if_any", the result would be the output of "count" which is the set of all
    # corners where the corner count is larger than 13.
    #
    # @h3 Expressions as objects @/h3
    #
    # The expression inside the "drc" function is a Ruby object and can be 
    # stored in variables. If you need the same expression multiple times, it can be 
    # more efficient to use the same Ruby object. In this example, the same expression
    # is used two times. Hence it's computed two times:
    #
    # @code
    # out = l1.drc(((primary & l2).area == 1.0) + ((primary & l2).area == 2.0))
    # @/code
    #
    # A more efficient version is:
    #
    # @code
    # overlap_area = (primary & l2).area
    # out = l1.drc((overlap_area == 1.0) + (overlap_area == 2.0))
    # @/code
    #
    # Note that the first line prepares the operation, but does not execute the area computation
    # or the boolean operation. But when the "drc" function executes the loop over the primaries it will 
    # only compute the area once per primary as it is represented by the same Ruby object.
    #
    # @h3 Outlook @/h3
    #
    # DRC expressions are quite rich and powerful. They provide a more intuitive way of
    # writing DRC expressions, are more efficient and open new opportunities. DRC
    # development is likely to focus on this scheme in the future.
    #
    # More formal details about the bits and pieces can be found in the "\DRC" class documentation.
