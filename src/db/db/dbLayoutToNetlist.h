/**
 *  @brief A generic framework for extracting netlists from layouts
 *
 *  This class wraps various concepts from db::NetlistExtractor and db::NetlistDeviceExtractor
 *  and more. It is supposed to provide a framework for extracting a netlist from a layout.
 *
 *  The use model of this class consists of five steps which need to be executed in this order.
 *
 *  @ul
 *  @li Configuration: in this step, the LayoutToNetlist object is created and
 *      if required, configured. Methods to be used in this step are "set_threads",
 *      "set_area_ratio" or "set_max_vertex_count". The constructor for the LayoutToNetlist
 *      object receives a db::RecursiveShapeIterator object which basically supplies the
 *      hierarchy and the layout taken as input.
 *  @/li
 *  @li Preparation
 *      In this step, the device recognitions and extraction layers are drawn from
 *      the framework. Derived can now be computed using boolean operations.
 *      Methods to use in this step are "make_layer" and it's variants.
 *      Layer preparation is not necessarily required to happen before all
 *      other steps. Layers can be computed shortly before they are required.
 *  @/li
 *  @li Following the preparation, the devices can be extracted using "extract_devices".
 *      This method needs to be called for each device extractor required. Each time,
 *      a device extractor needs to be given plus a map of device layers. The device
 *      layers are device extractor specific. Either original or derived layers
 *      may be specified here. Layer preparation may happen between calls to "extract_devices".
 *  @/li
 *  @li Once the devices are derived, the netlist connectivity can be defined and the
 *      netlist extracted. The connectivity is defined with "connect" and it's
 *      flavours. The actual netlist extraction happens with "extract_netlist".
 *  @/li
 *  @li After netlist extraction, the information is ready to be retrieved.
 *      The produced netlist is available with "netlist". The Shapes of a
 *      specific net are available with "shapes_of_net". "probe_net" allows
 *      finding a net by probing a specific location.
 *  @li

   *  @brief Builds a full hierarchical representation of the nets
   *
   *  This method copies all nets into cells corresponding to the circuits. It uses the cmap
   *  object to determine the target cell (create them with "cell_mapping_into" or "const_cell_mapping_into").
   *  If no mapping is requested, the specific circuit it skipped.
   *
   *  The method has three net annotation modes:
   *   * No annotation (net_cell_name_prefix == 0 and netname_prop == nil): the shapes will be put
   *     into the target cell simply
   *   * Net name property (net_cell_name_prefix == 0 and netname_prop != nil): the shapes will be
   *     annotated with a property named with netname_prop and containing the net name string.
   *   * Individual subcells per net (net_cell_name_prefix != 0): for each net, a subcell is created
   *     and the net shapes will be put there (name of the subcell = net_cell_name_prefix + net name).
   *     (this mode can be combined with netname_prop too).
   *
   *  In addition, net hierarchy is covered in three ways:
   *   * No connection indicated (hier_mode == BNH_Disconnected: the net shapes are simply put into their
   *     respective circuits. The connections are not indicated.
   *   * Subnet hierarchy (hier_mode == BNH_SubcircuitCells): for each root net, a full hierarchy is built
   *     to accommodate the subnets (see build_net in recursive mode).
   *   * Flat (hier_mode == BNH_Flatten): each net is flattened and put into the circuit it
   *     belongs to.
   *
   *  If a device cell name prefix is given, cells will be produced for each device abstract
   *  using a name like device_cell_name_prefix + device name. Otherwise the device shapes are
   *  treated as part of the net.

   *  on the cluster. Of all clusters where the antenna ratio is larger than

   *    A(antenna) = A + P * t

   *  micrometers.
   *
   *  The limit ratio can be modified by the presence of connections to
   *  other layers (specifically designating diodes for charge removal).
   *  Each of these layers will modify the ratio by adding a value of
   *  A(diode) / Ared[um^2] to the ratio. A(diode) is the area of the
   *  diode layer per cluster. Both the diode layer and the Ared value
   *  are specified as pairs in "diodes".

   *  A special case is Ared = 0: in this case, the presence of any shapes
   *  on the diode layer will entirely disable the check on a cluster,
   *  regardless of the diode's area.
   *  In other words: any diode will make the net safe against antenna discharge.
