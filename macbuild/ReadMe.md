Relevant KLayout version: 0.26.4

# 1. Introduction
This directory **`macbuild`** contains different files required for building KLayout (http://www.klayout.de/) version 0.26.1 or later for different 64-bit Mac OSXs including:
* El Capitan  (10.11)
* Sierra      (10.12)
* High Sierra (10.13)
* Mojave      (10.14)
* Catalina    (10.15)

# 2. Qt5 Frameworks
By default, Qt frameworks are "Qt5" from MacPorts (https://www.macports.org/) which is usually located under:
```
/opt/local/libexec/qt5/
```

Alternatively, you can use "Qt5" from Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) which is usually located under:
```
/usr/local/opt/qt/
```

   OR

"Qt5" from Anaconda3 (https://www.anaconda.com/) which is usually located under:
```
$HOME/opt/anaconda3/pkgs/qt-{version}
```

# 3. Script language support: Ruby and Python
By default, supported script languages, i.e., Ruby and Python, are those standard ones bundled with the OS.<br>
As for Catalina (10.15),
```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -v
  ruby 2.6.3p62 (2019-04-16 revision 67580) [universal.x86_64-darwin19]

$ /usr/bin/python --version
  Python 2.7.16
```
Even in the latest OS as of today (December 2019), Python 3.x is not bundled with the OS, and this is the main reason why users want non-OS-standard script language support.

To meet such a requirement, the build script **`build4mac.py`** provides several possible combinations of Qt5, Ruy and Python module.<br>
Some typical use cases are described in Section 6.

# 4. Prerequisites
You need to have:
* the latest Xcode and command-line tool kit compliant with each OS
* Qt5 package from MacPorts, Homebrew, or Anaconda3
* optionally Ruby and Python packages from MacPorts, Homebrew, or Anaconda3
#### For matching versions of Ruby and Python, please also refer to `build4mac_env.py`. ####

# 5. Command-line options of **`build4mac.py`** are as shown below.
```

# 6. Use-cases
In this section, the actual file- and directory names are those obtained on macOS Catalina.<br>
On different OS, those names differ accordingly.

### 6A. Standard build using the OS-bundled Ruby and Python
1. Invoke **`build4mac.py`** with the default options:
```
$ cd /where/'build.sh'/exists
$ ./build4mac.py
```
2. Confirm successful build (it will take about one hour depending on your machine spec).
3. Run **`build4mac.py`** again with the same options used in 1. PLUS "-y" to deploy executables and libraries (including Qt's frameworks) under **`klayout.app`** bundle.<br>
   The buddy command-line tools (strm*) will also be deployed in this step.
```
$ ./build4mac.py -y
```
  The application bundle **`klayout.app`** is located under:<br>
  **`ST-qt5MP.pkg.macos-Catalina-release-RsysPsys`** directory, where the three parts below are important.
* "ST-"      means that this is a standard package (LW-, HW-, and EX- are other possibilities explained below).
* "qt5MP"    means that Qt5 from MacPorts is used.
* "RsysPsys" means that Ruby is OS-bundled; Python is OS-bundled.
4. Copy/move the generated application bundle **`klayout.app`** to your **`/Applications`** directory for installation.

If you use "-Y" option instead of "-y" in Step-3, Qt5 frameworks is NOT deployed in the application bundle.<br>
Then the directory name will be **`LW-qt5MP.pkg.macos-Catalina-release-RsysPsys`**, where
* "LW-" means that this is a lightweight package.

#### If you build KLayout from the source code AND use it on the same machine, "-Y" option is highly recommended. ####

### 6B. Fully MacPorts-flavored build with MacPorts Ruby 2.6 and MacPorts Python 3.7
```
$ cd /where/'build.sh'/exists
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt5macports -r mp26 -p mp37
```
2. Confirm successful build (it will take about one hour depending on your machine spec).
3. Run **`build4mac.py`** again with the same options used in 1. PLUS "-Y" to deploy executables and libraries under **`klayout.app`** bundle.<br>
   The buddy command-line tools (strm*) will also be deployed in this step.
```
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt5macports -r mp26 -p mp37 -Y
```
  The application bundle **`klayout.app`** is located under:<br>
  **`LW-qt5MP.pkg.macos-Catalina-release-Rmp26Pmp37`** directory, where
* "LW-"        means that this is a lightweight package.
* "qt5MP"      means that Qt5 from MacPorts is used.
* "Rmp26Pmp37" means that Ruby is 2.6 from MacPorts; Python is 3.7 from MacPorts.
4. Copy/move the generated application bundle **`klayout.app`** to your **`/Applications`** directory for installation.

### 6C. Fully Homebrew-flavored build with Homebrew Ruby 2.7 and Homebrew Python 3.7
```
$ cd /where/'build.sh'/exists
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt5brew -r hb27 -p hb37
```
2. Confirm successful build (it will take about one hour depending on your machine spec).
3. Run **`build4mac.py`** again with the same options used in 1. PLUS "-Y" to deploy executables and libraries under **`klayout.app`** bundle.<br>
   The buddy command-line tools (strm*) will also be deployed in this step.
```
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt5brew -r hb27 -p hb37 -Y
```
  The application bundle **`klayout.app`** is located under:<br>
  **`LW-qt5Brew.pkg.macos-Catalina-release-Rhb27Phb37`** directory, where
* "LW-"        means that this is a lightweight package.
* "qt5Brew"    means that Qt5 from Homebrew is used.
* "Rhb27Phb37" means that Ruby is 2.7 from Homebrew; Python is 3.7 from Homebrew.
4. Copy/move the generated application bundle **`klayout.app`** to your **`/Applications`** directory for installation.

### 6D. Partially Homebrew-flavored build with System Ruby and Homebrew Python 3.7
```
$ cd /where/'build.sh'/exists
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt5brew -r sys -p hb37
```
2. Confirm successful build (it will take about one hour depending on your machine spec).
3. Run **`build4mac.py`** again with the same options used in 1. PLUS "-y" to deploy executables and libraries (including Qt's frameworks and Python frameworks) under **`klayout.app`** bundle.<br>
   The buddy command-line tools (strm*) will also be deployed in this step.
```
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt5brew -r sys -p hb37 -y
```
  The application bundle **`klayout.app`** is located under:<br>
  **`HW-qt5Brew.pkg.macos-Catalina-release-RsysPhb37`** directory, where
* "HW-"        means that this is a heavyweight package because both Qt5 and Python are deployed.
* "qt5Brew"    means that Qt5 from Homebrew is used.
* "RsysPhb37"  means that Ruby is OS-bundled; Python is 3.7 from Homebrew.
4. Copy/move the generated application bundle **`klayout.app`** to your **`/Applications`** directory for installation.
### Important ###
So far, deployment of Homebrew Ruby is not supported. <br>
Therefore, if you intend to use "-y" option, you need to use "-r sys" for building.

### 6E. Fully Anaconda3-flavored build with Anaconda3 Ruby 2.5 and Anaconda3 Python 3.7
```
$ cd /where/'build.sh'/exists
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt5ana3 -r ana3 -p ana3
```
2. Confirm successful build (it will take about one hour depending on your machine spec).
3. Run **`build4mac.py`** again with the same options used in 1. PLUS "-Y" to deploy executables and libraries under **`klayout.app`** bundle.<br>
   The buddy command-line tools (strm*) will also be deployed in this step.
```
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt5ana3 -r ana3 -p ana3 -Y
```
  The application bundle **`klayout.app`** is located under:<br>
  **`LW-qt5Ana3.pkg.macos-Catalina-release-Rana3Pana3`** directory, where
* "LW-"        means that this is a lightweight package.
* "qt5Ana3"    means that Qt5 from Anaconda3 is used.
* "Rana3Pana3" means that Ruby (2.5) is from Anaconda3; Python (3.7) is from Anaconda3.
4. Copy/move the generated application bundle **`klayout.app`** to your **`/Applications`** directory for installation.
5. You may have to set `PYTHONHOME` environment variable like:
```
export PYTHONHOME=$HOME/opt/anaconda3
```

### 6F. Other combinations
Logically, several different module combinations other than 6A. through 6E. are possible, including `nil` choice.<br>
If you choose such a combination, the resultant package directory name will begin with **`EX-`** (exceptional).

----

# 7. Making a DMG installer
You can make a DMG installer using another Python script **`makeDMG4mac.py`**.
This script requires a directory generated by **`build4mac.py`** with [-y|-Y] option (refer to 6A through 6E).

1. Make a symbolic link (if it does not exist) from the parent directory (where **`build.sh`** exists) to **`makeDMG4mac.py`**, that is,
```
makeDMG4mac.py -> macbuild/makeDMG4mac.py
```
2. Invoke **`makeDMG4mac.py`** with -p and -m options, for example,
```
$ cd /where/'build.sh'/exists
$ ./makeDMG4mac.py -p ST-qt5MP.pkg.macos-Catalina-release-RsysPsys -m
```
This command will generate the two files below:<br>
* **`ST-klayout-0.26.4-macOS-Catalina-1-qt5MP-RsysPsys.dmg`**      ---(1) the main DMG file
* **`ST-klayout-0.26.4-macOS-Catalina-1-qt5MP-RsysPsys.dmg.md5`**  ---(2) MD5-value text file

# Known issues
Because we assume some specific versions of non-OS-standard Ruby and Python, updating MacPorts, Homebrew, or Anaconda3 may cause build- and link errors.<br>
In such cases, you need to update the dictionary contents of **`build4mac_env.py`**.

# Final comments
No need to say, KLayout is a great tool! <br>
With the object-oriented script language (both Ruby and Python) support, our error-prone jobs can be simplified and speed-up.<br>
Building KLayout from its source code is not difficult. Try it with your favorite environment!
