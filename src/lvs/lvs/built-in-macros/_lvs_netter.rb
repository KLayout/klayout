  # @brief LVS Reference: Netter object
  # The Netter object provides services related to network extraction
  # from a layout plus comparison against a reference netlist.
  # Similar to the DRC \DRC::Netter (which lacks the compare ability), the
  # relevant method of this object are available as global functions too
  # where they act on a default incarnation. Usually it's not required
  # to instantiate a Netter object explicitly. 
  #
  # The LVS Netter object inherits all methods of the \DRC::Netter.
  #
  # An individual netter object can be created, if the netter results
  # need to be kept for multiple extractions. If you really need
  # a Netter object, use the global \global#netter function:
  #
  # @code
  # # create a new Netter object:
  # nx = netter
  #
  # # build connectivity
  # nx.connect(poly, contact)
  # ...
  #
  # # read the reference netlist
  # nx.schematic("reference.cir")
  #
  # # configure the netlist compare
  # nx.same_circuits("A", "B")
  # ...
  #
  # # runs the compare
  # if ! nx.compare
  #   puts("no equivalence!")
  # end
