  <title>Bookmarking Views</title>
  <keyword name="Bookmarks"/>

  <p>
  Views (window, cell) can be bookmarked for later retrieval. Choose
  "Bookmark This View" from the "Bookmarks" menu. A name is required to
  be entered for the bookmark. The bookmark will then appear in the "Goto
  Bookmarks" list.
  </p>
  <p>
  The list of bookmarks defined can be loaded or saved by using the "Load
  Bookmarks" and "Save Bookmarks" functions from the "Bookmarks" menu.
  </p>

  <p>
  The bookmark list is available as a dockable tool window as well:
  check the "View/Bookmark List" option to enable this dock window.
  The bookmark list by default is shown at the bottom right side of 
  the layout view.
  </p>

  <h2>Dockable Bookmark List</h2>

  <p>
  To navigate to a bookmark from the dockable bookmark list, double-click
  the entry.
  From the context menu (right mouse click) you can select these functions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Follow Selection</b>: if this option is checked, the selected
    bookmark will immediately change the view accordingly. With this
    option, you can browse the bookmark list with the arrow keys
    while the view updates automatically.
    </li>
    <li><b>Manage bookmarks</b>: opens the bookmark management dialog (same
    as from the "Bookmarks" menu).
    </li>
    <li><b>Load bookmarks</b> and <b>Save bookmarks</b>: loads or saves the 
    bookmarks to a file (same function as from the "Bookmarks" menu).
    </li>
  </ul>
