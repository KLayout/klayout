  "for all cells respectively. If you use \\unselect_all_cells and use \\select_cells for a specific cell, "
  "the iterator will deliver only the instances of the selected cell, not its children. Those are still "
  "unselected by \\unselect_all_cells:\n"
  "\n"
  "@code\n"
  "# deliver all instance inside \"MACRO\" but not of child cells:\n"
  "iter = RBA::RecursiveInstanceIterator::new(layout, cell)\n"
  "iter.unselect_all_cells\n"
  "iter.select_cells(\"MACRO\")\n"

  "\n"
  "Cell selection is done using cell indexes or glob pattern. Glob pattern are equivalent to the usual "
  "file name wildcards used on various command line shells. For example \"A*\" matches all cells starting with "
  "an \"A\". The curly brace notation and character classes are supported as well. For example \"C{125,512}\" matches "
  "\"C125\" and \"C512\" and \"[ABC]*\" matches all cells starting with an \"A\", a \"B\" or \"C\". \"[^ABC]*\" matches "
  "all cells not starting with one of that letters.\n"
  "\n"
  "To confine instance iteration to instances of certain cells, use the \\targets feature:\n"
  "\n"
  "@code\n"
  "# deliver all instance of \"INV1\":\n"
  "iter = RBA::RecursiveInstanceIterator::new(layout, cell)\n"
  "iter.targets = \"INV1\"\n"
  "...\n"
  "@/code\n"
  "\n"
  "Targets can be specified either as lists of cell indexes or through a glob pattern.\n"
  "\n"
  "Instances are always delivered depth-first with child instances before their parents. A default recursive instance "
  "iterator will first deliver leaf cells, followed by the parent of these cells.\n"
  "\n"
  "When a search region is used, instances whose bounding box touch or overlap (depending on 'overlapping' flag) will "
  "be reported. The instance bounding box taken as reference is computed using all layers of the layout.\n"
  "\n"
  "The iterator will deliver the individual elements of instance arrays, confined to the search region if one is given. "
  "Consequently the return value (\\current_inst_element) is an \\InstElement "
  "object which is basically a combination of an \\Instance object and information about the current array element.\n"
  "\\inst_cell, \\inst_trans and \\inst_dtrans are methods provided for convenience to access the current array member's transformation "
  "and the target cell of the current instance.\n"
  "\n"
  "The RecursiveInstanceIterator class has been introduced in version 0.27.\n"
