  "@brief A cell mapping (source to target layout)\n"
  "\n"
  "A cell mapping is an association of cells in two layouts forming pairs of cells, i.e. "
  "one cell corresponds to another cell in the other layout. The CellMapping object describes "
  "the mapping of cells of a source layout B to a target layout A. The cell mapping object "
  "is basically a table associating a cell in layout B with a cell in layout A.\n"
  "\n"
  "The cell mapping is of particular interest for providing the cell mapping recipe in "
  "\\Cell#copy_tree_shapes or \\Cell#move_tree_shapes.\n"
  "\n"
  "The mapping object is used to create and hold that table. There are three basic modes in which "
  "a table can be generated:\n"
  "\n"
  "@ul\n"
  "  @li Top-level identity (\\for_single_cell and \\for_single_cell_full) @/li\n"
  "  @li Top-level identify for multiple cells (\\for_multi_cells_full and \\for_multi_cells_full) @/li\n"
  "  @li Geometrical identity (\\from_geometry and \\from_geometry_full)@/li\n"
  "  @li Name identity (\\from_names and \\from_names_full) @/li\n"
  "@/ul\n"
  "\n"
  "'full' refers to the way cells are treated which are not mentioned. In the 'full' versions, "
  "cells for which no mapping is established explicitly - specifically all child cells in top-level identity modes - "
  "are created in the target layout and instantiated according to their source layout hierarchy. Then, these new "
  "cells become targets of the respective source cells. "
  "In the plain version (without 'full' cells), no additional cells are created. For the case of \\Layout#copy_tree_shapes "
  "cells not explicitly mapped are flattened. Hence for example, \\for_single_cell will flatten all children of the source cell during "
  "\\Layout#copy_tree_shapes or \\Layout#move_tree_shapes.\n"
  "\n"
  "Top-level identity means that only one cell (the top cell) is regarded identical. All child cells are "
  "not considered identical. In full mode (see below), this will create a new, identical cell tree "
  "below the top cell in layout A.\n"
  "\n"
  "Geometrical identity is defined by the "
  "exact identity of the set of expanded instances in each starting cell. Therefore, when "
  "a cell is mapped to another cell, shapes can be transferred from one cell to another "
  "while effectively rendering the same flat geometry (in the context of the given starting cells). "
  "Location identity is basically the safest way to map cells from one hierarchy into another, because it preserves the flat shape "
  "geometry. However in some cases the algorithm may find multiple mapping candidates. In that "
  "case it will make a guess about what mapping to choose.\n"
  "\n"
  "Name identity means that cells are identified by their names - for a source cell in layer B, a target "
  "cell with the same name is looked up in the target layout A and a mapping is created if a cell with the same name "
  "is found. However, name identity does not mean that the cells are actually equivalent "
  "because they may be placed differently. Hence, cell mapping by name is not a good choice when "
  "it is important to preserve the shape geometry of a layer.\n"
  "\n"
  "A cell might not be mapped to another cell which basically means that there is no corresponding cell. "
  "In this case, flattening to the next mapped cell is an option to transfer geometries despite the "
  "missing mapping. You can enforce a mapping by using the mapping generator methods in 'full' mode, i.e. "
  "\\from_names_full or \\from_geometry_full. These versions will create new cells and their corresponding "
  "instances in the target layout if no suitable target cell is found.\n"
  "\n"
  "This is a simple example for a cell mapping preserving the hierarchy of the source cell and creating "
  "a hierarchy copy in the top cell of the target layout ('hierarchical merge'):\n"
