 *
 *  This function uses the set of bitmaps in "pbitmaps" with the given set
 *  of view operands in "view_ops" and converts these into the QImage 
 *  with the given width and height.
 *  The "view_ops" and "pbitmaps" vectors must have the same size.
 *  The QImage must be initialized to the given width and height.
 *  If the QMutex pointer is not 0, the mutex is locked between operations 
 *  if the bitmap is accessed. The set of dither pattern specifies any custom
 *  pattern that are used bz the view operands.
 *  The "use_bitmap_index" parameter specifies whether the bitmap_index
 *  parameter of the operators is being used to map a operator to a certain
 *  bitmap.
