  "The cell view points to a specific cell within a certain layout and a hierarchical context.\n"
  "For that, first of all a layout pointer is provided. The cell itself\n"
  "is addressed by an cell_index or a cell object reference.\n"
  "The layout pointer can be nil, indicating that the cell view is invalid.\n"

  "by the path leading to that cell. This path indicates how to find the\n"
  "cell in the hierarchical context of it's parent cells. \n"
  "\n"
  "The path is in fact composed of two parts: first in an unspecific fashion,\n"
  "just describing which parent cells are used. The target of this path\n"
  "is called the \"context cell\". It is accessible by the \\ctx_cell_index\n"
  "or \\ctx_cell methods. In the viewer, the unspecific part of the path is\n"
  "the location of the cell in the cell tree.\n"
  "\n"
  "Additionally the path's second part may further identify a specific instance of a certain\n"
  "subcell in the context cell. This is done through a set of \\InstElement\n"
  "objects. The target of this specific path is the actual cell addressed by the\n"
  "cellview. This target cell is accessible by the \\cell_index or \\cell methods.\n"
  "In the viewer, the target cell is shown in the context of the context cell.\n"
  "The hierarchy levels are counted from the context cell, which is on level 0.\n"
  "If the context path is empty, the context cell is identical with the target cell.\n"

  "effect on the display. For example, the following code will select a different cell:\n"
