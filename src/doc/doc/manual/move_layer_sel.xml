  <title>Moving Shapes To A Different Layer</title>
  <keyword name="Editing"/>

  <p>
  The selected shapes can be moved to a different layer as a whole.
  For this, choose "Change Layer" from the "Selection" submenu of the "Edit" menu.
  All selected shapes are moved to the layer that is the current one (marked with a rectangle) in the layer list.
  The shapes will not be moved across the hierarchy but just inside their cell.
  </p>

  <p>
  All layers (source and target) must be located in the same layout. To move shapes to a 
  different layout, use copy &amp; paste.
  </p>

  <p>
  You can also change the layer in the shape properties. This will effectively
  move shapes to other layers too.
