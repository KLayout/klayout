    # @brief Adds cell name expressions to the cell filters

    # This method will construct a new source object with the given cell filters 
    # applied.
    # Cell filters will enable or disable cells plus their subtree.
    # Cells can be switched on and off, which makes the hierarchy traversal
    # stop or begin delivering shapes at the given cell. The arguments of 
    # the select method form a sequence of enabling or disabling instructions
    # using cell name pattern in the glob notation ("*" as the wildcard, like shell).
    # Disabling instructions start with a "-", enabling instructions with a "+" or
    # no specification.
    #
    # The following options are available:
    # 
    # @ul
    # @li @tt+@/tt @i name_filter @/i: Cells matching the name filter will be enabled @/li
    # @li @i name_filter @/i: Same as "+name_filter" @/li
    # @li @tt-@/tt @i name_filter @/i: Cells matching the name filter will be disabled @/li
    # @/ul
    #
    # To disable the TOP cell but enabled a hypothetical cell B below the top cell, use that
    # code:
    #
    # @code
    # layout_with_selection = source.select("-TOP", "+B")
    # l1 = source.input(1, 0)
    # ...
    # @/code
    #
    # Please note that the sample above will deliver the children of "B" because there is 
    # nothing said about how to proceed with cells other than "TOP" or "B". Conceptually,
    # the instantiation path of a cell will be matched against the different filters in the
    # order they are given.
    # A matching negative expression will disable the cell, a matching positive expression
    # will enable the cell. Hence, every cell that has a "B" in the instantiation path 
    # is enabled.
    #
    # The following code will just select "B" without its children, because in the 
    # first "-*" selection, all cells including the children of "B" are disabled:
    #
    # @code
    # layout_with_selection = source.select("-*", "+B")
    # l1 = source.input(1, 0)
    # ...
    # @/code
    # 
    # The short form "-" will disable the top cell. This code is identical to the first example
    # and will start with a disabled top cell regardless of its name:
    # 
    # @code
    # layout_with_selection = source.select("-", "+B")

    # Creates a layer with the shapes from the given layer of the source.
    # The layer can be specified by layer and optionally datatype, by a RBA::LayerInfo
    # object or by a sequence of filters. 
    # Filters are expressions describing ranges
    # of layers and/or datatype numbers or layer names. Multiple filters
    # can be given and all layers matching at least one of these filter
    # expressions are joined to render the input layer for the DRC engine.
    #
    # Some filter expressions are:
    #
    # @ul
    # @li @tt 1/0-255 @/tt: Datatypes 0 to 255 for layer 1 @/li
    # @li @tt 1-10 @/tt: Layers 1 to 10, datatype 0 @/li
    # @li @tt METAL @/tt: A layer named "METAL" @/li

    # @/ul
    #
    # Layers created with "input" may contain both texts (labels) and polygons. There is a subtle
    # difference between flat and deep mode: in flat mode, texts are not visible in polygon
    # operations. In deep mode, texts appear as small 2x2 DBU rectangles. In flat mode, 
    # some operations such as clipping are not fully supported for texts. Also, texts will
    # vanish in most polygon operations such as booleans etc.
    #
    # Texts can later be selected on the layer returned by "input" with the \Layer#texts method.
    #
    # If you don't want to see texts, use \polygons to create an input layer with polygon data
    # only. If you only want to see texts, use \labels to create an input layer with texts only.
    #
    # \labels also produces a true "text layer" which contains text objects. A variety of 
    # operations is available for these objects, such as boolean "and" and "not" with a polygon layer.
    # True text layers should be preferred over mixed polygon/text layers if text object processing
    # is required.
