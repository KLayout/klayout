class AbstractMenu:

    @brief An abstraction for the application menus

    The abstract menu is a class that stores a main menu and several popup menus
    in a generic form such that they can be manipulated and converted into GUI objects.

    Each item can be associated with a Action, which delivers a title, enabled/disable state etc.
    The Action is either provided when new entries are inserted or created upon initialisation.

    The abstract menu class provides methods to manipulate the menu structure (the state of the
    menu items, their title and shortcut key is provided and manipulated through the Action object). 

    Menu items and submenus are referred to by a "path". The path is a string with this interpretation:

    @<table>
      @<tr>@<td>""                 @</td>@<td>is the root@</td>@</tr> 
      @<tr>@<td>"[<path>.]<name>"  @</td>@<td>is an element of the submenu given by <path>. If <path> is omitted, this refers to an element in the root@</td>@</tr> 
      @<tr>@<td>"[<path>.]end"     @</td>@<td>refers to the item past the last item of the submenu given by <path> or root@</td>@</tr>
      @<tr>@<td>"[<path>.]begin"   @</td>@<td>refers to the first item of the submenu given by <path> or root@</td>@</tr>
      @<tr>@<td>"[<path>.]#<n>"    @</td>@<td>refers to the nth item of the submenu given by <path> or root (n is an integer number)@</td>@</tr>
    @</table>

    Menu items can be put into groups. The path strings of each group can be obtained with the 
    "group" method. An item is put into a group by appending ":<group-name>" to the item's name.
    This specification can be used several times.

    Detached menus (i.e. for use in context menus) can be created as virtual top-level submenus
    with a name of the form "@@<name>". A special detached menu is "@toolbar" which represents the tool bar of the main window. 
    Menus are closely related to the \Action class. Actions are used to represent selectable items inside menus, provide the title and other configuration settings. Actions also link the menu items with code. See the \Action class description for further details.

class Action(ActionBase):
    r"""
    @brief The abstraction for an action (i.e. used inside menus)

    Actions act as a generalization of menu entries. The action provides the appearance of a menu entry such as title, key shortcut etc. and dispatches the menu events. The action can be manipulated to change to appearance of a menu entry and can be attached an observer that receives the events when the menu item is selected.

    Multiple action objects can refer to the same action internally, in which case the information and event handler is copied between the incarnations. This way, a single implementation can be provided for multiple places where an action appears, for example inside the toolbar and in addition as a menu entry. Both actions will shared the same icon, text, shortcut etc.

    Actions are mainly used for providing new menu items inside the \AbstractMenu class. This is some sample Ruby code for that case:

    @code
    a = RBA::Action.new
    a.title = "Push Me!"
    a.on_triggered do 
      puts "I was pushed!"
    end

    app = RBA::Application.instance
    mw = app.main_window

    menu = mw.menu
    menu.insert_separator("@toolbar.end", "name")
    menu.insert_item("@toolbar.end", "my_action", a)
    @/code

    This code will register a custom action in the toolbar. When the toolbar button is pushed a message is printed. The toolbar is addressed by a path starting with the pseudo root "@toolbar".

    In Version 0.23, the Action class has been merged with the ActionBase class.

class Annotation(BasicAnnotation):
    r"""
    @brief A layout annotation (i.e. ruler)

    Annotation objects provide a way to attach measurements or descriptive information to a layout view. Annotation objects can appear as rulers for example. Annotation objects can be configured in different ways using the styles provided. By configuring an annotation object properly, it can appear as a rectangle or a plain line for example.
    See @<a href="/manual/ruler_properties.xml">Ruler properties@</a> for more details about the appearance options.

    Annotations are inserted into a layout view using \LayoutView#insert_annotation. Here is some sample code in Ruby:

    @code
    app = RBA::Application.instance
    mw = app.main_window
    view = mw.current_view

    ant = RBA::Annotation::new
    ant.p1 = RBA::DPoint::new(0, 0)
    ant.p2 = RBA::DPoint::new(100, 0)
    ant.style = RBA::Annotation::StyleRuler
    view.insert_annotation(ant)
    @/code

    Annotations can be retrieved from a view with \LayoutView#each_annotation and all annotations can be cleared with \LayoutView#clear_annotations.

    Starting with version 0.25, annotations are 'live' objects once they are inserted into the view. Changing properties of annotations will automatically update the view (however, that is not true the other way round).

    Here is some sample code of changing the style of all rulers to two-sided arrows:

    @code
    view = RBA::LayoutView::current

    begin

      view.transaction("Restyle annotations")

      view.each_annotation do |a|
        a.style = RBA::Annotation::StyleArrowBoth

class CellView:
    r"""
    @brief A class describing what is shown inside a layout view

    The cell view points to a specific cell within a certain layout and a hierarchical context.
    For that, first of all a layout pointer is provided. The cell itself
    is addressed by an cell_index or a cell object reference.
    The layout pointer can be nil, indicating that the cell view is invalid.

    The cell is not only identified by its index or object but also 
    by the path leading to that cell. This path indicates how to find the
    cell in the hierarchical context of its parent cells. 

    The path is in fact composed of two parts: first in an unspecific fashion,
    just describing which parent cells are used. The target of this path
    is called the "context cell". It is accessible by the \ctx_cell_index
    or \ctx_cell methods. In the viewer, the unspecific part of the path is
    the location of the cell in the cell tree.

    Additionally the path's second part may further identify a specific instance of a certain
    subcell in the context cell. This is done through a set of \InstElement
    objects. The target of this specific path is the actual cell addressed by the
    cellview. This target cell is accessible by the \cell_index or \cell methods.
    In the viewer, the target cell is shown in the context of the context cell.
    The hierarchy levels are counted from the context cell, which is on level 0.
    If the context path is empty, the context cell is identical with the target cell.

    Starting with version 0.25, the cellview can be modified directly. This will have an immediate effect on the display. For example, the following code will select a different cell:

    @code
    cv = RBA::CellView::active
    cv.cell_name = "TOP2"
    @/code

class Image(BasicImage):
    r"""
    @brief An image to be stored as a layout annotation

    Images can be put onto the layout canvas as annotations, along with rulers and markers.
    Images can be monochrome (represent scalar data) as well as color (represent color images).
    The display of images can be adjusted in various ways, i.e. color mapping (translation of scalar values to
    colors), geometrical transformations (including rotation by arbitrary angles) and similar.
    Images are always based on floating point data. The actual data range is not fixed and can be adjusted to the data set (i.e. 0..255 or -1..1). This gives a great flexibility when displaying data which is the result of some measurement or calculation for example.
    The basic parameters of an image are the width and height of the data set, the width and height of one pixel, the geometrical transformation to be applied, the data range (min_value to max_value) and the data mapping which is described by an own class, \ImageDataMapping.

    Starting with version 0.22, the basic transformation is a 3x3 matrix rather than the simple affine transformation. This matrix includes the pixel dimensions as well. One consequence of that is that the magnification part of the matrix and the pixel dimensions are no longer separated. That has certain consequences, i.e. setting an affine transformation with a magnification scales the pixel sizes as before but an affine transformation returned will no longer contain the pixel dimensions as magnification because it only supports isotropic scaling. For backward compatibility, the rotation center for the affine transformations while the default center and the center for matrix transformations is the image center.

    As with version 0.25, images become 'live' objects. Changes to image properties will be reflected in the view automatically once the image object has been inserted into a view. Note that changes are not immediately reflected in the view, but are delayed until the view is refreshed. Hence, iterating the view's images will not render the same results than the image objects attached to the view. To ensure synchronization, call \Image#update.

    @brief A structure describing the data mapping of an image object

    Data mapping is the process of transforming the data into RGB pixel values.
    This implementation provides four adjustment steps: first, in the case of monochrome
    data, the data is converted to a RGB triplet using the color map. The default color map
    will copy the value to all channels rendering a gray scale. After having normalized the data 
    to 0..1 cooresponding to the min_value and max_value settings of the image, a color channel-independent
    brightness and contrast adjustment is applied. Then, a per-channel multiplier (red_gain, green_gain,
    blue_gain) is applied. Finally, the gamma function is applied and the result converted into a 0..255 
    pixel value range and clipped.

    This iterator provides a flat view for the layers in the layer tree if used with the next method. In this mode it will descend into the hierarchy and deliver node by node as a linear (flat) sequence.

    The iterator also plays an important role for manipulating the layer properties tree, i.e. by specifying insertion points in the tree for the \LayoutView class.

        The image is written as a PNG file to the given file. The image is drawn synchronously with the given width and height. Drawing may take some time. Monochrome images don't have background or annotation objects currently.

        The 'linewidth' factor scales the layout style line widths.

        The 'oversampling' factor will use multiple passes passes to create a single image pixels. An oversampling factor of 2 uses 2x2 virtual pixels to generate an output pixel. This results in a smoother image. This however comes with a corresponding memory and run time penalty. When using oversampling, you can set linewidth and resolution to 0. This way, line widths and stipple pattern are scaled such that the resulting image is equivalent to the standard image.

        The 'resolution' is the pixel size used to translate font sizes and stipple pattern. A resolution of 0.5 renders twice as large fonts and stipple pattern. When combining this value with an oversampling factor of 2 and a line width factor of 2, the resulting image is an oversampled version of the standard image.

        Examples:

        @code
        # standard image 500x500 pixels (oversampling as configured in the view)
        layout_view.save_image_with_options("image.png", 500, 500)

    @brief A macro class

    This class is provided mainly to support generation of template macros in the DSL interpreter framework provided by \MacroInterpreter. The implementation may be enhanced in future versions and provide access to macros stored inside KLayout's macro repository.
    But it can be used to execute macro code in a consistent way:

    @code
    path = "path-to-macro.lym"
    RBA::Macro::new(path).run()
    @/code

    Using the Macro class with \run for executing code will chose the right interpreter and is able to execute DRC and LVS scripts in the proper environment. This also provides an option to execute Ruby code from Python and vice versa.

    In this scenario you can pass values to the script using \Interpreter#define_variable. The interpreter to choose for DRC and LVS scripts is \Interpreter#ruby_interpreter. For passing values back from the script, wrap the variable value into a \Value object which can be modified by the called script and read back by the caller.

    @li In the initialize method configure the object using the attribute setters like \suffix= and register the object as DSL interpreter (in that order) @/li
    @li Create at least one template macro in the initialize method @/li
    @/ul

    Template macros provide a way for the macro editor to present macros for the new interpreter in the list of templates. Template macros can provide menu bindings, shortcuts and some initial text for example

    The simple implementation can be enhanced by providing more information, i.e. syntax highlighter information, the debugger to use etc. This involves reimplementing further methods, i.e. "syntax_scheme".

    This is a simple example for an interpreter in Ruby. Is is registered under the name 'simple-dsl' and just evaluates the script text:

    @code
    class SimpleExecutable < RBA::Excutable

      # Constructor
      def initialize(macro)
        \@macro = macro
      end
  
      # Implements the execute method
      def execute
        eval(\@macro.text, nil, \@macro.path)
        nil
      end

    end

    class SimpleInterpreter < RBA::MacroInterpreter

      # Constructor
      def initialize
        self.description = "A test interpreter"
        # Registers the new interpreter
        register("simple-dsl")
        # create a template for the macro editor:
        # Name is "new_simple", the description will be "Simple interpreter macro"
        # in the "Special" group.
        mt = create_template("new_simple")
        mt.description = "Special;;Simple interpreter macro"
      end
  
      # Creates the executable delegate
      def executable(macro)
        SimpleExecutable::new(macro)
      end

    end

    # Register the new interpreter
    SimpleInterpreter::new

    @/code

    Please note that such an implementation is dangerous because the evaluation of the script happens in the context of the interpreter object. In this implementation the script could redefine the execute method for example. This implementation is provided as an example only.
    A real implementation should add execution of prolog and epilog code inside the execute method and proper error handling.

    In order to make the above code effective, store the code in an macro, set "early auto-run" and restart KLayout.

    A shape or instance is addressed by a path which describes all instances leading to the specified
    object. These instances are described through \InstElement objects, which specify the instance and, in case of array instances, the specific array member.
    For shapes, additionally the layer and the shape itself is specified. The ObjectInstPath objects
    encapsulates both forms, which can be distinguished with the \is_cell_inst? predicate.

    An instantiation path leads from a top cell down to the container cell which either holds the shape or the instance.
    The top cell can be obtained through the \top attribute, the container cell through the \source attribute. Both are cell indexes which can be converted to \Cell objects through the \Layout#cell. In case of objects located in the top cell, \top and \source refer to the same cell.
    The first element of the instantiation path is the instance located within the top cell leading to the first child cell. The second element leads to the next child cell and so forth. \path_nth can be used to obtain a specific element of the path.

    The \cv_index attribute specifies the cellview the selection applies to. Use \LayoutView#cellview to obtain the \CellView object from the index.

    The shape or instance the selection refers to can be obtained with \shape and \inst respectively. Use \is_cell_inst? to decide whether the selection refers to an instance or not.

    The ObjectInstPath class plays a role when retrieving and modifying the selection of shapes and instances through \LayoutView#object_selection, \LayoutView#object_selection=, \LayoutView#select_object and \LayoutView#unselect_object. \ObjectInstPath objects can be modified to reflect a new selection, but the new selection becomes active only after it is installed in the view. The following sample demonstrates that. It implements a function to convert all shapes to polygons:

    @code
    mw = RBA::Application::instance::main_window
    view = mw.current_view

    begin

      view.transaction("Convert selected shapes to polygons")

      sel = view.object_selection

      sel.each do |s|
        if !s.is_cell_inst? && !s.shape.is_text?
          ly = view.cellview(s.cv_index).layout
          # convert to polygon
          s.shape.polygon = s.shape.polygon
        end
      end
  
      view.object_selection = sel

    ensure
      view.commit
    end
    @/code

    Note, that without resetting the selection in the above example, the application might raise errors because after modifying the selected objects, the current selection will no longer be valid. Establishing a new valid selection in the way shown above will help avoiding this issue.

class PluginFactory:
    r"""
    @brief The plugin framework's plugin factory object

    Plugins are components that extend KLayout's functionality in various aspects. Scripting support exists currently for providing mouse mode handlers and general on-demand functionality connected with a menu entry.

    Plugins are objects that implement the \Plugin interface. Each layout view is associated with one instance of such an object. The PluginFactory is a singleton which is responsible for creating \Plugin objects and providing certain configuration information such as where to put the menu items connected to this plugin and what configuration keys are used.

    An implementation of PluginFactory must at least provide an implementation of \create_plugin. This method must instantiate a new object of the specific plugin.

    After the factory has been created, it must be registered in the system using one of the \register methods. It is therefore recommended to put the call to \register at the end of the "initialize" method. For the registration to work properly, the menu items must be defined before \register is called.

    The following features can also be implemented:

    @<ul>
      @<li>Reserve keys in the configuration file using \add_option in the constructor@</li>
      @<li>Create menu items by using \add_menu_entry in the constructor@</li>
      @<li>Set the title for the mode entry that appears in the tool bar using the \register argument@</li>
      @<li>Provide global functionality (independent from the layout view) using \configure or \menu_activated@</li>
    @</ul>

    This is a simple example for a plugin in Ruby. It switches the mouse cursor to a 'cross' cursor when it is active:

    @code
    class PluginTestFactory < RBA::PluginFactory

      # Constructor
      def initialize
        # registers the new plugin class at position 100000 (at the end), with name
        # "my_plugin_test" and title "My plugin test"
        register(100000, "my_plugin_test", "My plugin test")
      end
  
      # Create a new plugin instance of the custom type
      def create_plugin(manager, dispatcher, view)
        return PluginTest.new
      end

    end

    # The plugin class
    class PluginTest < RBA::Plugin
      def mouse_moved_event(p, buttons, prio)
        if prio
          # Set the cursor to cross if our plugin is active.
          set_cursor(RBA::Cursor::Cross)
        end
        # Returning false indicates that we don't want to consume the event.
        # This way for example the cursor position tracker still works.
        false
      end
      def mouse_click_event(p, buttons, prio)
        if prio
          puts "mouse button clicked."
          # This indicates we want to consume the event and others don't receive the mouse click
          # with prio = false.
          return true
        end
        # don't consume the event if we are not active.
        false
      end
    end

    # Instantiate the new plugin factory.
