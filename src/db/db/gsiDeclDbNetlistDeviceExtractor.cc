  "\n"
  "This class serves as a base class for implementing customized device extractors. "
  "This class does not provide any extraction functionality, so you have to "

  "\n"
  "Device extraction requires a few definitions. The definitions are made in the reimplementation of the \\setup\n"
  "method. Required definitions to be made are:\n"
  "\n"
  "@ul\n"
  "  @li The name of the extractor. This will also be the name of the device class produced by the extractor. "
  "      The name is set using \\name=. @/li\n"
  "  @li The device class of the devices to produce. The device class is registered using \\register_device_class. @/li\n"
  "  @li The layers used for the device extraction. These are input layers for the extraction as well as "
  "      output layers for defining the terminals. Terminals are the poins at which the nets connect to the devices.\n"
  "      Layers are defined using \\define_layer. Initially, layers are abstract definitions with a name and a description.\n"
  "      Concrete layers will be given when defining the connectivitiy. @/li\n"
  "@/ul\n"
  "\n"
  "When the device extraction is started, the device extraction algorithm will first ask the device extractor "
  "for the 'connectivity'. This is not a connectivity in a sense of electrical connections. The connectivity defines are "
  "logical compound that makes up the device. 'Connected' shapes are collected and presented to the device extractor.\n"
  "The connectivity is obtained by calling \\get_connectivity. This method must be "
  "implemented to produce the connectivity.\n"
  "\n"
  "Finally, the individual devices need to be extracted. Each cluster of connected shapes is presented to the "
  "device extractor. A cluster may include more than one device. It's the device extractor's responsibilty to "
  "extract the devices from this cluster and deliver the devices through \\create_device. In addition, terminals "
  "have to be defined, so the net extractor can connect to the devices. Terminal definitions are made through "
  "\\define_terminal. The device extraction is implemented in the \\extract_devices method.\n"
  "\n"
  "If errors occur during device extraction, the \\error method may be used to issue such errors. Errors "
  "reported this way are kept in the error log.\n"
