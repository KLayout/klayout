This is a temporary file containing some development notes regarding generating py stubs (https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubgen.html) for klayout python's C-extension. This enables syntax highlighting and type checking from compatible IDEs like VS Code.

It is possible to annotate C-extension docstrings to include function signatures, which helps with argument inspection.

This is not enough for type hints or code completion from IDEs. For that, we need to create stubs. Luckily, there is a nice tool from mypy called stubgen:
https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubgen.html

The stub generated by the stubgen does not produce the docstrings, though. There is an open issue on github about that.
https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11965

I patched the stubgen program temporarily to fit our needs. See branch: https://github.com/thomaslima/mypy/tree/issue-klayout

Run stubgen as such:
`$ stubgen -m klayout.dbcore -o src/pymod/distutils_src/`
`$ stubgen -m klayout.tlcore -o src/pymod/distutils_src/`
`$ stubgen -m klayout.rdbcore -o src/pymod/distutils_src/`
`$ stubgen -m klayout.libcore -o src/pymod/distutils_src/`

TODO:
- [x] 1. Complete signature generation for all methods in pyaModule.cc. A line containing func(arg1, arg2) should suffice. Multiple lines automatically generate overloading.
- [x] 2. Patch stubgen so that it can create docstrings. (Or wait for issue 11965 to be resolved)
- [x] 3. Generate stubs for klayout.*core.
- [ ] 4. Manually check and backannotate types in klayout.*core.pyi.
- [ ] 5. How to update the stubs if klayout code changes? Manually for now.
