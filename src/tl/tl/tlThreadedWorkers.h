/**
 *  @brief A threaded worker framework
 *
 *  The threaded worker framework provides a way to control multiple workers performing operations
 *  on some database or data repository object. The framework provides a way to control the workers, in 
 *  particular kick off and shut down worker threads. It does not deal with the issue of the database
 *  object being thread-safe. 
 *
 *  The general concept involves 
 *  1.) A boss (tl::Boss class). There is one boss instance per "database" instance. The boss must be 
 *      in some way associated with the database.
 *      The boss provides a way to control several jobs, i.e. stop them if required. 
 *  2.) Jobs: multiple jobs (tl::Job objects) can be registered under one boss. 
 *      A job is not necessarily running or terminated. It can be started, 
 *      stopped, restarted or terminated. A job is initialized in the main thread and
 *      sets up the threads which actually do the job (workers). 
 *      A job may be associated with multiple boss instances.
 *  3.) Workers: a job can be split into multiple tasks which are executed by the workers. A worker is
 *      a thread which receives tasks through a task queue.
