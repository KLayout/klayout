# 1. Introduction
This directory **`macbuild`** contains different files required for building KLayout (http://www.klayout.de/) version 0.27.5 or later for different 64-bit macOS, including:
* Catalina    (10.15.7) : the primary development environment
* Big Sur     (11.x)    : experimental; Apple M1 chip is not tested since the author does not own an M1 Mac
* Monterey    (12.x)    : -- ditto --

Building KLayout for the previous operating systems listed below should still be possible. <br>
However, they are not actively supported, and DMG packages for them are not provided.
* Mojave      (10.14)
* High Sierra (10.13)
* Sierra      (10.12)
* El Capitan  (10.11)

Throughout this document, the primary target machine is **Intel x86_64** with **macOS Catalina**.<br>
A **((Notes))** marker indicates special notes for specific operating systems.

# 2. Qt6/Qt5 Frameworks
By default, the Qt framework is "Qt6" from Homebrew (https://brew.sh/), which is usually located under:
```
/usr/local/opt/qt@6/
```

"Qt5" is usually located under:
```
/usr/local/opt/qt@5/
```

Alternatively, you can use "Qt6" from MacPorts (https://www.macports.org/), which is usually located under:
```
/opt/local/libexec/qt6/
```
**((Notes))** As of 2021-11-27, MacPorts' Qt6 does not provide `qt6-qtmultimedia`, which causes a build error!!!

"Qt5" is usually located under:
```
/opt/local/libexec/qt5/
```

   OR

"Qt5" from Anaconda3 (https://www.anaconda.com/), which is usually located under:
```
$HOME/opt/anaconda3/pkgs/qt-{version}
```

If you have installed Anaconda3 under $HOME/opt/anaconda3/, make a symbolic link:
```
/Applications/anaconda3/ ---> $HOME/opt/anaconda3/
```

# 3. Script language support: Ruby and Python
Earlier, by default, supported script languages, i.e., Ruby and Python, were those standard ones bundled with the OS.<br>
This configuration is possible only for macOS Catalina (10.15.7).<br>
```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -v
  ruby 2.6.3p62 (2019-04-16 revision 67580) [universal.x86_64-darwin19]

$ /usr/bin/python --version
  Python 2.7.16
```

Big Sur (11.x) and Monterey (12.x) still provide the Python 2.7 binaries to run various legacy applications.<br>
However, the latest Xcode 13.1 does not allow us to link the legacy Python 2.7 library with the newly compiled KLayout binaries.<br>
Therefore, Homebrew is adopted as the default environment for Big Sur and Monterey.

The build script **`build4mac.py`** provides several possible combinations of Qt[6|5], Ruy, and Python modules to accommodate such a slightly complex environment.<br>
Some typical use cases are described in Section 6.

# 4. Prerequisites
You need to have:
* the latest Xcode and command-line tool kit compliant with each OS
* Qt[6|5] package from Homebrew or MacPorts; Qt5 from Anaconda3
* optionally Ruby and Python packages from Homebrew, MacPorts, or Anaconda3
#### For matching versions of Ruby and Python, please also refer to `build4mac_env.py`.

# 5. Command-line options of **`build4mac.py`** are as shown below.
**((Notes))** For **Catalina**

# 6. Use-cases
In this section, the actual file names and directory names are those obtained on macOS Catalina.<br>
On different OS, those names differ accordingly.

### 6A. Standard build using the OS-bundled Ruby and Python
0. Install Homebrew, then install Qt6 by
```
$ brew install qt6
```
1. Invoke **`build4mac.py`** with the default options: **((Notes))** only for Catalina
```
$ cd /where/'build.sh'/exists
$ ./build4mac.py
```
2. Confirm successful build (it will take about one hour depending on your machine spec).
3. Run **`build4mac.py`** again with the same options used in 1. PLUS "-y" to deploy executables and libraries (including Qt's framework) under **`klayout.app`** bundle.<br>
   The buddy command-line tools (strm*) will also be deployed in this step.
```
$ ./build4mac.py -y
```
  The application bundle **`klayout.app`** is located under:<br>
  **`ST-qt6Brew.pkg.macos-Catalina-release-RsysPsys`** directory, where the three name parts below are important.
* "ST-"      means that this is a standard package (LW-, HW-, and EX- are other possibilities explained below).
* "qt6Brew"  means that Qt6 from Homebrew is used.
* "RsysPsys" means that Ruby is OS-bundled; Python is OS-bundled.
4. Copy/move the generated application bundle **`klayout.app`** to your **`/Applications`** directory for installation.

If you use the "-Y" option instead of the "-y" in Step-3, the Qt6 framework is NOT deployed in the application bundle.<br>
Then the directory name will be **`LW-qt6Brew.pkg.macos-Catalina-release-RsysPsys`**, where
* "LW-" means that this is a lightweight package.

#### If you build KLayout from the source code AND run it on the same machine, the "-Y" option is highly recommended.

### 6B. Fully MacPorts-flavored build with MacPorts Ruby 2.7 and MacPorts Python 3.8
0. Install MacPorts, then install Qt6, Ruby 2.7, and Python 3.8 by
```
$ sudo port install coreutils
$ sudo port install findutils
$ sudo port install qt6
$ sudo port install qt6-qttools
$ sudo port install ruby27
$ sudo port install python38
$ sudo port install py38-pip
```
1. Invoke **`build4mac.py`** with the following options:
```
$ cd /where/'build.sh'/exists
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt6macports -r mp27 -p mp38
```
2. Confirm successful build (it will take about one hour depending on your machine spec).
3. Run **`build4mac.py`** again with the same options used in 1. PLUS "-Y" to deploy executables and libraries under **`klayout.app`** bundle.<br>
   The buddy command-line tools (strm*) will also be deployed in this step.
```
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt6macports -r mp27 -p mp38 -Y
```
  The application bundle **`klayout.app`** is located under:<br>
  **`LW-qt6MP.pkg.macos-Catalina-release-Rmp27Pmp38`** directory, where
* "LW-"        means that this is a lightweight package.
* "qt6MP"      means that Qt6 from MacPorts is used.
* "Rmp27Pmp38" means that Ruby is 2.7 from MacPorts; Python is 3.8 from MacPorts.
4. Copy/move the generated application bundle **`klayout.app`** to your **`/Applications`** directory for installation.

### 6C. Fully Homebrew-flavored build with Homebrew Ruby 2.7 and Homebrew Python 3.8
0. Install Homebrew, then install Qt6, Ruby 2.7, and Python 3.8 by
```
$ brew install qt6
$ brew install ruby@2.7
$ brew install python@3.8
```
1. Invoke **`build4mac.py`** with the following options: **((Notes))** These options are the default for Big Sur and Monterey.
```
$ cd /where/'build.sh'/exists
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt6brew -r hb27 -p hb38
```
2. Confirm successful build (it will take about one hour depending on your machine spec).
3. Run **`build4mac.py`** again with the same options used in 1. PLUS "-Y" to deploy executables and libraries under **`klayout.app`** bundle.<br>
   The buddy command-line tools (strm*) will also be deployed in this step.
```
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt6brew -r hb27 -p hb38 -Y
```
  The application bundle **`klayout.app`** is located under:<br>
  **`LW-qt6Brew.pkg.macos-Catalina-release-Rhb27Phb38`** directory, where
* "LW-"        means that this is a lightweight package.
* "qt6Brew"    means that Qt6 from Homebrew is used.
* "Rhb27Phb38" means that Ruby is 2.7 from Homebrew; Python is 3.8 from Homebrew.
4. Copy/move the generated application bundle **`klayout.app`** to your **`/Applications`** directory for installation.

### 6D. Partially Homebrew-flavored build with System Ruby and Homebrew Python 3.8
0. Install Homebrew, then install Qt6 and Python 3.8 by
```
$ brew install qt6
$ brew install python@3.8
```
1. Invoke **`build4mac.py`** with the following options:
```
$ cd /where/'build.sh'/exists
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt6brew -r sys -p hb38
```
2. Confirm successful build (it will take about one hour depending on your machine spec).
3. Run **`build4mac.py`** again with the same options used in 1. PLUS "-y" to deploy executables and libraries (including Qt's framework and Python framework) under **`klayout.app`** bundle.<br>
   The buddy command-line tools (strm*) will also be deployed in this step.
```
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt6brew -r sys -p hb38 -y
```
  The application bundle **`klayout.app`** is located under:<br>
  **`HW-qt6Brew.pkg.macos-Catalina-release-RsysPhb38`** directory, where
* "HW-"        means that this is a heavyweight package because both Qt6 and Python Frameworks are deployed.
* "qt6Brew"    means that Qt6 from Homebrew is used.
* "RsysPhb38"  means that Ruby is OS-bundled; Python is 3.8 from Homebrew.
4. Copy/move the generated application bundle **`klayout.app`** to your **`/Applications`** directory for installation.
### Important
So far, the deployment of Homebrew Ruby is not supported. <br>
Therefore, if you intend to use the "-y" option for deployment, you need to use the "-r sys" option for building.

### 6E. Fully Anaconda3-flavored build with Anaconda3 Ruby 2.5 and Anaconda3 Python 3.8
0. Install Anaconda3, then install Ruby 2.5 by
```
$ conda install ruby
```
1. Invoke **`build4mac.py`** with the following options:
```
$ cd /where/'build.sh'/exists
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt5ana3 -r ana3 -p ana3
```
2. Confirm successful build (it will take about one hour depending on your machine spec).
3. Run **`build4mac.py`** again with the same options used in 1. PLUS "-Y" to deploy executables and libraries under **`klayout.app`** bundle.<br>
   The buddy command-line tools (strm*) will also be deployed in this step.
```
$ ./build4mac.py -q qt5ana3 -r ana3 -p ana3 -Y
```
  The application bundle **`klayout.app`** is located under:<br>
  **`LW-qt5Ana3.pkg.macos-Catalina-release-Rana3Pana3`** directory, where
* "LW-"        means that this is a lightweight package.
* "qt5Ana3"    means that Qt5 from Anaconda3 is used.
* "Rana3Pana3" means that Ruby (2.5) is from Anaconda3; Python (3.8) is from Anaconda3.
4. Copy/move the generated application bundle **`klayout.app`** to your **`/Applications`** directory for installation.
5. You may have to set `PYTHONHOME` environment variable like:
```
export PYTHONHOME=$HOME/opt/anaconda3
```

### 6F. Other combinations
Logically, several different module combinations other than 6A. through 6E. are possible, including `nil` choice.<br>
If you choose such a combination, the resultant package directory name will begin with **`EX-`** (exceptional).

# 7. Making a DMG installer
You can make a DMG installer using another Python script **`makeDMG4mac.py`**.
This script requires a directory generated by **`build4mac.py`** with the [-y|-Y] option (refer to 6A through 6E).

1. Make a symbolic link (if it does not exist) from the parent directory (where **`build.sh`** exists) to **`makeDMG4mac.py`**, that is,
```
makeDMG4mac.py -> macbuild/makeDMG4mac.py
```
2. Invoke **`makeDMG4mac.py`** with -p and -m options, for example,
```
$ cd /where/'build.sh'/exists
$ ./makeDMG4mac.py -p ST-qt6Brew.pkg.macos-Catalina-release-RsysPsys -m
```
This command will generate the two files below:<br>
* **`ST-klayout-0.27.5-macOS-Catalina-1-qt6Brew-RsysPsys.dmg`**      ---(1) the main DMG file
* **`ST-klayout-0.27.5-macOS-Catalina-1-qt6Brew-RsysPsys.dmg.md5`**  ---(2) MD5-value text file

# Known issues
Because we assume some specific versions of non-OS-standard Ruby and Python, updating Homebrew, MacPorts, or Anaconda3 may cause build- and link errors.<br>
In such cases, you need to update the dictionary contents of **`build4mac_env.py`**.

# Final comments
No need to say, KLayout is a great tool! <br>
With the object-oriented script language (both Ruby and Python) support, our error-prone layout jobs can be greatly simplified and speed-up.<br>
Building KLayout from its source code is not difficult. Try it with your favorite environment!
