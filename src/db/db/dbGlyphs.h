/**
 *  @brief A basic text field generator class
 *
 *  Each text generator corresponds to a specific font. Each font is defined by a file
 *  located in the <application_path>/font directories. Font files are standard GDS or
 *  OASIS files.
 *
 *  By convention the files must have two to three layers:
 *
 *    1/0 for the actual data
 *    2/0 for the borders
 *    3/0 for an optional additional background
 *
 *  Currently, all glyphs must be bottom-left aligned at 0, 0. The
 *  border must be drawn in at least one glyph cell. The border is taken
 *  as the overall bbox of all borders.
 *
 *  The glyph cells must be named with a single character or "nnn" where "d" is the
 *  ASCII code of the character (i.e. "032" for space). Allowed ASCII codes are 32 through 127.
 *  If a lower-case "a" character is defined, lower-case letters are supported.
 *  Otherwise, lowercase letters are mapped to uppercase letters.
 *
 *  Undefined characters are left blank.
 *
 *  A comment cell can be defined ("COMMENT") which must hold one text in layer 1
 *  stating the comment, and additional descriptions such as line width:
 *
 *    line_width = x       Specifies the line width in µm
 *    design_grid = x      Specifies the design grid in µm
 *    <any other text>     The description string
